                Characterization of ischemia-reperfusion injury of skeletal muscle remains poorly defined. A new quantitative assay to measure ischemic skeletal muscle injury is described and validated in a rat hindlimb model. This biochemical spectrophotometric technique measures triphenyltetrazolium chloride reduction in ischemic muscle. The reduction assay demonstrated significant injury after 3 hours of ischemia (25.4 +/- 9.7 percent of control activity; p less than 0.05). More severe injury occurred after 4 or more hours (less than 3 percent of control activity; p less than 0.05). This assay is an objective and quantitative method for characterizing ischemia-reperfusion injury.

                The management of an acutely ischemic extremity requires knowledge of the response of skeletal muscle (the largest component of the lower limb) to prolonged periods of complete normothermic ischemia. We have used the canine gracilis muscle model to evaluate the extent and distribution of ischemic necrosis after 3 and 5 hours of ischemia and 48 hours of reperfusion. Each muscle was cut into six slices, and the extent and distribution of postischemic necrosis identified by means of nitroblue tetrazolium staining and {99mTc} pyrophosphate uptake. After 3, 4, and 5 hours of ischemia the extent of necrosis was 2.0\% +/- 0.9\%, 30.3\% +/- 6.0\%, and 90.1\% +/- 3.5\% (mean +/- {SEM}), respectively. A statistically significant correlation exists between the extent of necrosis and the uptake of {99mTc} pyrophosphate uptake per gram of tissue (y = 1574.9x - 8.4, r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). Most necrosis was centrally located and found in the thickest portion of the muscle. We conclude that there is a graded response in the extent of skeletal muscle necrosis related to the length of ischemic stress rather than an "all-or-none" phenomenon. This central distribution of necrosis makes the usual external evaluation of ischemic damage clinically unreliable. In addition, since there was no enveloping fascia in this model, a compartment release alone may not prevent the development of skeletal muscle necrosis. This knowledge of the response of skeletal muscle to ischemia may lead to an improved clinical approach to an extremity suffering a prolonged ischemic insult.

                Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a life-threatening type of pressure ulcer which initiates subdermally with muscle necrosis at weight-bearing anatomical locations, where localized elevated tissue strains exist. Though it has been suggested that excessive sustained soft tissue strains might compromise cell viability, which then initiates the {DTI}, there is no experimental evidence to describe how specifically such a process might take place. Here, we experimentally test the hypothesis that macroscopic tissue deformations translated to cell-level deformations and in particular, to localized tensile strains in the plasma membrane ({PM}) of cells, increase the permeability of the {PM} which could disrupt vital transport processes. In order to determine whether {PM} permeability changes can occur due to static stretching of cells we measured the uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate ({FITC})-labeled Dextran (molecular weight = 4 {kDa}) by deformed vs. undeformed myoblasts, using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting ({FACS}) method. These {PM} permeability changes were then correlated with tensile strains in the {PM} which correspond to the levels of substrate tensile strain ({STS}) that were applied in the experiments. The {PM} strains were evaluated by means of confocal-microscopy-based cell-specific finite element ({FE}) modeling. The {FACS} studies demonstrated a statistically significant rise in the uptake of the {FITC}-labeled Dextran with increasing {STS} levels in the {STS} ≤ 12\% domain, which thereby indicates a rise in the permeability of the {PM} of the myoblasts with the extent of the applied cellular deformation. The cell-specific {FE} modeling simulating the experiments further demonstrated that applying average {PM} tensile strains which exceed 3\%, or, applying peak {PM} tensile strains over 9\%, substantially increases the permeability of the {PM} of myoblasts to the Dextran. Moreover, the permeability of the {PM} grew rapidly with any further increase in {PM} strains, though there were no significant changes in the uptake above average and peak {PM} tensile strain values of 9 and 26\%, respectively. These results provide an experimental basis for studying the theory that cell-level deformation-diffusion relationships may be involved in determining the tolerance of soft tissues to sustained mechanical loading, as relevant to the etiology of {DTI}.

                Pressure ulcers are a serious health issue, leading to clinical, financial, and emotional challenges. Numerous treatment modalities are available to promote wound healing, yet clinicians may be unsure how to incorporate these treatment options into an overall plan of care for the patient with a pressure ulcer. A consensus panel of experienced wound care clinicians convened in July 2004 to review the mechanisms of action and research basis for one such treatment modality: negative pressure wound therapy. After answering key questions about this modality, they developed an algorithm to assist the clinician in making decisions about using negative pressure wound therapy appropriately in patients with Stage {III} and Stage {IV} pressure ulcers.

                The characterization and calibration of ultrasound imaging systems requires tissue-mimicking phantoms with known acoustic properties, dimensions and internal features. Tissue phantoms are available commercially for a range of medical applications. However, commercial phantoms may not be suitable in ultrasound system design or for evaluation of novel imaging techniques. It is often desirable to have the ability to tailor acoustic properties and phantom configurations for specific applications. A multitude of tissue-mimicking materials and phantoms are described in the literature that have been created using a variety of materials and preparation techniques and that have modeled a range of biological systems. This paper reviews ultrasound tissue-mimicking materials and phantom fabrication techniques that have been developed over the past four decades, and describes the benefits and disadvantages of the processes. Both soft tissue and hard tissue substitutes are explored.

                Knowledge on the forces acting on a woman's breast and on the mechanical properties of the breast tissues is important for studying the effects of plastic surgery techniques for breast reconstruction as well as for the design of cosmetic breast implants. Surprisingly, there are no data in the literature regarding mechanical loads on the breast tissues during daily or sport activities, and there are no coherent sources of data in regard to mechanical properties of the breast tissues. Accordingly, this paper is aimed at reviewing the mechanics of the normal breast. First, the anatomy of the breast and major aging-related changes are described. Second, the mechanical characteristics of all tissue components of the breast are detailed. Last, analytical approximations are made in regard to the forces acting on the breast during normal activity, and the respective internal breast forces supported by the suspensory ligaments, pectoralis fascia and ribs are calculated. The data presented in this paper are useful for biomechanical modeling of the breast as well as for evaluating the loads acting on surgical repairs and breast implants.

                Characterizing compressive transient large deformation properties of biological tissue is becoming increasingly important in impact biomechanics and rehabilitation engineering, which includes devices interfacing with the human body and virtual surgical guidance simulation. Individual mechanical in vivo behaviour, specifically of human gluteal adipose and passive skeletal muscle tissue compressed with finite strain, has, however, been sparsely characterised. Employing a combined experimental and numerical approach, a method is presented to investigate the time-dependent properties of in vivo gluteal adipose and passive skeletal muscle tissue. Specifically, displacement-controlled ramp-and-hold indentation relaxation tests were performed and documented with magnetic resonance imaging. A time domain quasi-linear viscoelasticity ({QLV}) formulation with Prony series valid for finite strains was used in conjunction with a hyperelastic model formulation for soft tissue constitutive model parameter identification and calibration of the relaxation test data. A finite element model of the indentation region was employed. Strong non-linear elastic but linear viscoelastic tissue material behaviour at finite strains was apparent for both adipose and passive skeletal muscle mechanical properties with orthogonal skin and transversal muscle fibre loading. Using a force-equilibrium assumption, the employed material model was well suited to fit the experimental data and derive viscoelastic model parameters by inverse finite element parameter estimation. An individual characterisation of in vivo gluteal adipose and muscle tissue could thus be established. Initial shear moduli were calculated from the long-term parameters for human gluteal skin/fat: {G(∞,S}/F)=1850 Pa and for cross-fibre gluteal muscle tissue: {G(∞,M})=881 Pa. Instantaneous shear moduli were found at the employed ramp speed: {G(0,S}/F)=1920 Pa and {G(0,M})=1032 Pa.

                Deep pressure ulcers are caused by sustained mechanical loading and involve skeletal muscle tissue injury. The exact underlying mechanisms are unclear, and the prevalence is high. Our hypothesis is that the aetiology is dominated by cellular deformation (Bouten et al. in Ann Biomed Eng 29:153-163, 2001; Breuls et al. in Ann Biomed Eng 31:1357-1364, 2003; Stekelenburg et al. in J App Physiol 100(6):1946-1954, 2006) and deformation-induced ischaemia. The experimental observation that mechanical compression induced a pattern of interspersed healthy and dead cells in skeletal muscle (Stekelenburg et al. in J App Physiol 100(6):1946-1954, 2006) strongly suggests to take into account the muscle microstructure in studying damage development. The present paper describes a computational model for deformation-induced hypoxic damage in skeletal muscle tissue. Dead cells stop consuming oxygen and are assumed to decrease in stiffness due to loss of structure. The questions addressed are if these two consequences of cell death influence the development of cell injury in the remaining cells. The results show that weakening of dead cells indeed affects the damage accumulation in other cells. Further, the fact that cells stop consuming oxygen after they have died, delays cell death of other cells.

                Prolonged mechanical loading of soft tissues adjacent to bony prominences can lead to degeneration of muscle tissue, resulting in a condition termed pressure-related deep tissue injury. This type of deep pressure ulcers can develop into a severe wound, associated with problematic healing and a variable prognosis. Limited knowledge of the underlying damage pathways impedes effective preventive strategies and early detection. Traditionally, pressure-induced ischaemia has been thought to be the main aetiological factor for initiating damage. Recent research, however, proposes tissue deformation per se as another candidate for initiating pressure-induced deep tissue injury. In this study, different strain parameters were evaluated on their suitability as a generic predictive indicator for deep tissue injury. With a combined animal-experimental numerical approach, we show that there is a reproducible monotonic increase in damage with increasing maximum shear strain once a strain threshold has been exceeded. This relationship between maximum shear strain and damage seems to reflect an intrinsic muscle property, as it applied across a considerable number of the experiments. This finding confirms that tissue deformation per se is important in the aetiology of deep tissue injury. Using dedicated finite element modeling, a considerable reduction in the inherent biological variation was obtained, leading to the proposal that muscle deformation can prove a generic predictive indicator of damage.

                Pressure induced deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a severe form of pressure ulcers that is hard to detect in early stages and difficult to prevent and treat. High prevalence figures are partly due to a lack of understanding of pathological pathways involved in {DTI}. The aim of this study was to investigate, whether changes in material properties of damaged tissue can play a role in {DTI} aetiology. A numerical model was developed based on muscle microstructure and tissue engineering experiments. A time dependent damage law was proposed and stiffening of dead cells incorporated. The results obtained in the microstructural investigations were used to include the stiffening information in a pre-existing macroscopic model based on animal experiments, which correlated strains to tissue damage measured in the tibialis anterior muscle in rat limbs. With the modelling approach employed in this paper, the damaged area in the rat limb models increased up to 1.65-fold and the rate of damage progression was up to 2.1 times higher in microstructural simulations when stiffening was included.

                Sustained mechanical loading of skeletal muscle may result in the development of a severe type of pressure ulcer, referred to as deep tissue injury. Recently it was shown that the diffusion of large molecules ({10-150kDa}) is impaired during deformation of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle, suggesting a role for impaired diffusion in the aetiology of deep tissue injury. However, the influence of deformation on diffusion of smaller molecules on its aetiology is less clear. This motivated the present study designed to investigate the influence of deformation of skeletal muscle on the diffusion of water, which can be measured with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). It could be predicted that this approach will provide valuable information on the diffusion of small molecules. Additionally the relationship between muscle temperature and diffusion was investigated. During deformation of the tibialis anterior a decrease of the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC}) was observed (7.2+/-3.9\%). The use of a finite element model showed that no correlation existed between the maximum shear strain and the decrease of the {ADC}. The {ADC} in the uncompressed gastrocnemius muscle decreased with 5.9+/-3.7\%. In an additional experiment a clear correlation was obtained between the decrease of the {ADC} and the relative temperature change of skeletal muscle tissue as measured by {MRI}. Taken together, it was concluded that (1) the decreased diffusion of water was not a direct effect of tissue deformation and (2) that it is likely that the observed decreased {ADC} during deformation was a result of a decreased muscle temperature. The present study therefore provides evidence that diffusion of small molecules, particularly oxygen and carbon dioxide, is not impaired during deformation of skeletal muscle tissue.

                Mechanical loading of soft tissues covering bony prominences can cause skeletal muscle damage, ultimately resulting in a severe pressure ulcer termed deep tissue injury ({DTI}). Deformation plays an important role in the aetiology of {DTI}. Therefore, it is essential to minimise internal muscle deformations in subjects at risk of {DTI}. As an example, spinal cord-injured ({SCI}) individuals exhibit structural changes leading to a decrease in muscle thickness and stiffness, which subsequently increase the tissue deformations. In the present study, an animal-specific finite element model, where the geometry and boundary conditions were derived from magnetic resonance images, was developed. It was used to investigate the internal deformations in the muscle, fat and skin layers of the porcine buttocks during loading. The model indicated the presence of large deformations in both the muscle and the fat layers, with maximum shear strains up to 0.65 in muscle tissue and 0.63 in fat. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis showed that the tissue deformations depend considerably on the relative stiffness values of the different tissues. For example, a change in muscle stiffness had a large effect on the muscle deformations. A 50\% decrease in stiffness caused an increase in maximum shear strain from 0.65 to 0.99, whereas a 50\% increase in stiffness resulted in a decrease in maximum shear strain from 0.65 to 0.49. These results indicate the importance of restoring tissue properties after {SCI}, with the use of, for example, electrical stimulation, to prevent the development of {DTI}.

                Early detection and intervention of deep tissue injury is important to lead good outcome. While the efficiency of ultrasonographic assessment of deep tissue injury has been reported previously, it requires a certain level of skill for accurate assessment. Here, we present our investigation of the combination of thermographic and ultrasonographic assessments for early detection of deep tissue injury. We retrospectively reviewed 28 early-stage pressure ulcers (21 patients) presenting at the University of Tokyo Hospital between April 2009 and February 2010, surveying the associated thermographic findings and ultrasonographic findings. The wound temperature patterns were divided into low, even and high compared with the surrounding skin. Ultrasonographic findings were divided into unclear layer structure, hypoechoic lesion, discontinuous fascia and heterogeneous hypoechoic area. All 13 ulcers that were associated with low temperature showed good outcome; three ulcers had even temperatures and 12 ulcers showed high temperature on thermographic assessment. The two deep tissue injuries were rated high on thermographic assessment and showed heterogeneous hypoechoic area findings on ultrasonographic assessment. No non deep tissue injury lesion was associated with these two findings simultaneously. The combination of thermographic and ultrasonographic assessments is expected to increase the accuracy of the early detection of deep tissue injuries.

                Pressure ulcer prevention strategies include the prevention, and early recognition, of deep tissue injury ({DTI}), which can evolve into a Stage {III} or Stage {IV} pressure ulcer. In addition to their role in pressure-induced ischemia, shearing forces are believed to contribute substantially to the risk of {DTI}. Because the visual manifestation of a {DTI} may not occur until many hours after tissues were damaged, research to explore methods for early detection is on-going. For example, rhabdomyolysis is a common complication of deep tissue damage; its detection via blood chemistry and urinalysis is explored as a possible diagnostic tool of early {DTI} in anatomical areas where muscle is present. Substances released from injured muscle cells have a predictable time frame for detection in blood and urine, possibly enabling the clinician to estimate the time of the tissue death. Several small case studies suggest the potential validity and reliability of ultrasoun for visualizing soft tissue damage also deserve further research. While recommendations to reduce mechanical pressure and shearing damage in high-risk patients remain unchanged, their implementation is not always practical, feasible, or congruent with the overall plan of patient care. Early detection of existing tissue damage will help clinicians implement appropriate care plans that also may prevent further damage. Research to evaluate the validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnostic studies to detect pressure-related tissue death is warranted.

                With the aging population and increasing complexity of patients with pressure ulcers ({PrUs}), as well as regulatory requirements, {PrUs} have become an important concern for physicians. Although there are some studies that measure nurses' knowledge of {PrUs}, there is a paucity of literature about physician knowledge of {PrUs}. Given that the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services is holding physicians accountable for documenting {PrU} status on admission to hospitals and the increased need for collaboration with revisions to long-term-care documentation {MDS} 3.0: Skin Condition, physicians' knowledge regarding {PrUs} takes on new urgency. This study reports on {PrU} knowledge of physicians using 2 tools: the Pieper Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Tool and a wound photograph test. Physicians' mean scores of 69\% on the Pieper Tool were well below average scores of nurses' 76\%. Physicians had greatest difficulty identifying suspected deep tissue injury and unstageable ulcers. Pressure ulcer content, including prevention, identification, staging, and treatment, needs to be included in physician education.

Incorrect responses were most common for statements related to stage {III}, {IAD} for {PUCS} \& {IAD} {KT}, and suspected deep tissue injury ({SDTI}), unstageable, and stage {III} for {PUCS} \& {IAD} {VDT}. Significant correlations were found between {PUCS} \& {IAD} {KT} and {VDT} (r=.48, p<.001). Factors affecting scores for {PUCS} \& {IAD} {VDT} were {PUCS} \& {IAD} {KT}, frequency of pressure ulcer, {IAD} management and participation in wound care education programs.

                We have proposed a muscle model which consists of two Maxwell elements and a Voigt element in parallel. The muscle model was applied on the experiment of the force responses by the fast ramp stretch in muscle fibres to determine the mechanical parameters. In the simulation, the Maxwell element with a flexible spring and a long relaxation time seemed to correspond with the force-generating state of the cross-bridges. Next, we tried the muscle model to simulate the relatively slow movement. Experimentally, we have measured torque changes by the stretch responses in the human triceps surae. In the experiments, the derivation of torque by rotation angle showed two peaks P1 and P2. The first peak P1 originated from the elastic properties of engaged cross-bridges, while the second peak P2 was due to stretch reflex signals. The model of a single-joint system simulated well with the experimental results to show a good adaptability of the muscle model.

                Improving the numerical models of the head and neck complex requires understanding the mechanical properties of the muscles; however, most of the data in existing literature have been obtained from studies on animal muscles. Muscle is hyper-elastic, but also viscoelastic. The hyper-elastic behaviour of the human sternocleidomastoideus muscle has been previously studied. The aim of this study is to propose a characterization of the viscoelastic properties of the same human muscle in relaxation. Ten muscles were tested in vitro. The viscoelastic behaviour was modelled with a generalized Maxwell's model studied at the first and second order, using an inverse approach with a subject-specific, finite-element model of each muscle. Based on these models, relaxation times τ (first order: 103s; second order: 18s and 395s) and ratio moduli γ (first order: 0.33; second order: 0.20 and 0.19) were identified. The first-order model provided a good estimate of the relaxation curve (R(2): 0.82), but the second-order model was more representative of the experimental response (R(2): 0.97). Our results provide evidence that the viscoelastic behaviour of the human sternocleidomastoideus muscle can be described using a second-order Maxwell's model and that - combined with the previously identified hyper-elastic properties - the response of the muscle in tension and relaxation is fully characterized.

                Pressure-related deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a life-risking form of pressure ulcers threatening immobilized and neurologically impaired patients. In {DTI}, necrosis of muscle and enveloping adipose tissues occurs under intact skin, owing to prolonged compression by bony prominences. Modeling the process of {DTI} in the buttocks requires knowledge on viscoelastic mechanical properties of the white adipose tissue covering the gluteus muscles. However, this information is missing in the literature. Our major objectives in this study were therefore to (i) measure short-term ({H(S})) and long-term ({H(L})) aggregate moduli of adipose tissue covering the glutei of sheep, (ii) determine the effects of preconditioning on {H(S}) and {H(L}), and (iii) determine the time course of stress relaxation in terms of the transient aggregate modulus H(t) in nonpreconditioned ({NPC}) and preconditioned ({PC}) tissues. We tested 20 fresh tissue specimens (from 20 mature animals) in vitro: 10 specimens in confined compression for obtaining the complete H(t) response to a ramp-and-hold protocol (ramp rate of 300 mms), and 10 other specimens in swift indentations for obtaining comparable short-term elastic moduli at higher ramp rates (2000 mms). We found that {H(S}) in confined compression were 28.9+/-14.9 {kPa} and 18.1+/-6.9 {kPa} for the {NPC} and {PC} specimens, respectively. The {H(L}) property, 10.3+/-4.2 {kPa}, was not affected by preconditioning. The transient aggregate modulus H(t) always reached the plateau phase (less than 10\% difference between H(t) and {H(L})) within 2 min, which is substantially shorter than the times for {DTI} onset reported in previous animal studies. The short-term elastic moduli at high indentation rates were 22.6+/-10 {kPa} and 15.8+/-9.4 {kPa} for the {NPC} and {PC} test conditions, respectively. Given a Poisson's ratio of 0.495, comparison of short-term elastic moduli between the high and slow rate tests indicated a strong deformation-rate dependency. The most relevant property for modeling adipose tissue as related to {DTI} is found to be {H(L}), which is conveniently unaffected by preconditioning.

                Striated respiratory muscles are necessary for lung ventilation and to maintain the patency of the upper airway. The basic structural and functional properties of respiratory muscles are similar to those of other striated muscles (both skeletal and cardiac). The sarcomere is the fundamental organizational unit of striated muscles and sarcomeric proteins underlie the passive and active mechanical properties of muscle fibers. In this respect, the functional categorization of different fiber types provides a conceptual framework to understand the physiological properties of respiratory muscles. Within the sarcomere, the interaction between the thick and thin filaments at the level of cross-bridges provides the elementary unit of force generation and contraction. Key to an understanding of the unique functional differences across muscle fiber types are differences in cross-bridge recruitment and cycling that relate to the expression of different myosin heavy chain isoforms in the thick filament. The active mechanical properties of muscle fibers are characterized by the relationship between myoplasmic Ca2+ and cross-bridge recruitment, force generation and sarcomere length (also cross-bridge recruitment), external load and shortening velocity (cross-bridge cycling rate), and cross-bridge cycling rate and {ATP} consumption. Passive mechanical properties are also important reflecting viscoelastic elements within sarcomeres as well as the extracellular matrix. Conditions that affect respiratory muscle performance may have a range of underlying pathophysiological causes, but their manifestations will depend on their impact on these basic elemental structures. {\copyright} 2013 American Physiological Society.

                The maximum tetanic tension of skeletal muscle (P(0)) is often estimated based on calculation of physiological cross-sectional area ({PCSA}). {PCSA} depends on muscle volume, pennation angle, and fiber length. Studies documenting {PCSA} in fixed human muscles usually compute muscle volume by dividing muscle mass by density. These studies use a density value of 1.0597 g/cm(3), which was originally based on unfixed rabbit and canine muscle tissue. Due to the dehydration effects of different fixation methods, the variable hydration that occurs when fixed tissue is stored in buffered saline, and the potential for species-specific muscle density, this value may be incorrect and an accurate value for fixed human muscle density is needed. To obtain an accurate density and water content values, 4\% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) and 37\% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) cadaveric human muscle samples were divided into 6 groups (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 h) for hydration in phosphate buffered saline ({PBS}). Measurements of volume, water content, and mass were made enabling calculation of muscle density. Additionally, water content was measured in living muscle (n=4) to determine the appropriate hydration time in {PBS}. Comparisons among groups demonstrated a significant increase in muscle water content and muscle volume over time, reaching living tissue levels after 24h, but, interestingly, the hydration process did not affect muscle density. These data yield a density value ({mean+/-SE}) of 1.112+/-0.006 g/cm(3) in 4\% formaldehyde-fixed muscle and 1.055+/-0.006 g/cm(3) in 37\% formaldehyde-fixed muscle. These results indicate that the use of inappropriate hydration times or density values can produce {PCSA} errors of 5-10\%.

Whole muscle force (Fo) was quantified for extensor digitorum longus ({EDL}) muscles of {OA} and young adult ({YA}) rats. {EDL} muscle {sFo} was calculated by dividing Fo by either total muscle fiber cross-sectional area ({CSA}) or by innervated fiber {CSA}. Innervated fiber {CSA} was estimated from {EDL} muscle cross sections labeled for neural cell adhesion molecules, whose presence is a marker for muscle fiber denervation. {EDL} muscles from {OA} rats contained significantly more denervated fibers than muscles from {YA} rats (5.6\% vs 1.1\% of total {CSA}). When compared with {YA} muscle, {OA} muscle demonstrated deficits of 34.1\% for Fo, 28.3\% for {sFo}, and 24.9\% for {sFo} calculated by using innervated {CSA} as the denominator. Denervated muscle fibers accounted for 11.3\% of the specific force difference between normal {YA} and {OA} skeletal muscle.

                Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a severe medical complication that commonly affects those with spinal cord injury. It is caused by prolonged external loading of the muscles, entrapping them between a bony prominence and the support surface. The entrapment causes excessive mechanical deformation and increases in interstitial pressure, leading to muscle breakdown deep around the bony prominences. We proposed the use of intermittent electrical stimulation ({IES}) as a novel prophylactic method for the prevention of {DTI}. In this study, we assessed the long-term effectiveness of this technique in pigs that had received a partial spinal cord injury that paralyzed one hindlimb. The pigs recovered for 2 wk postsurgery, and subsequently, their paralyzed limbs were loaded to 25\% of their body weights 4 h/day for 4 consecutive days each week for 1 mo. One group of pigs (n = 3) received {IES} during the loading, whereas another group (n = 3) did not. {DTI} was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and postmortem histology. In the group that did not receive {IES}, {MRI} assessments revealed signs of tissue damage in 48\% of the volume of the loaded muscle. In the group that did receive {IES}, only 8\% of the loaded muscle volume showed signs of tissue damage. Similar findings were found through postmortem histology. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that {IES} may be an effective technique for preventing the formation of {DTI} in loaded muscles after spinal cord injury.

                A method has been developed which can predict the appearance and properties of B-scan images. The theoretical basis for the tissue models used, and the assumptions made in the simulation concerning the nature of pulse-echo imaging, are discussed. A key feature of the simulation is the Fourier domain synthesis of the tissue model, which permits convenient specification of some statistical properties of a randomly inhomogeneous scattering medium. Other characteristics that may be specified include the ultrasonic pulse and beam shapes, and subsequent signal processing. Both the initial tissue model and the simulated B-scan image are displayed as grey-scale pictures, allowing visual comparison in the same way that clinical B-scans are currently observed. Preliminary results of applying the simulation are shown to have a number of features in common with clinical images and with scans of a test object. A better understanding of the nature of pulse-echo images is gained and conclusions drawn regarding the range of system and tissue parameters over which these images convey information about the tissue structure. The method may also be of use to determine optimum design of equipment for imaging and tissue characterisation, and to investigate the extent to which the acoustic structure of tissues can be described in terms of simple mathematical models.

Sitting in a wheelchair was monitored and processed with the portable system for six control subjects and five individuals with paraplegia. We compared the resultant internal peak and average muscle stresses and stress integrals over time (stress doses) of the control subjects with those of the subjects with paraplegia and validated the results against previously published subject-specific finite element ({FE}) stress data for the same subjects. Individuals with paraplegia were characterized by peak muscle compression stresses (mean +/- standard deviation = 109 +/- 41 {kPa}) that were 2.4-fold higher than in control subjects (p < 0.03). A {Bland-Altman} comparison indicated that stresses recorded by the present system were in satisfactory agreement with previous subject-specific magnetic resonance {imaging-FE} analyses. We conclude that the present stress monitoring system has the potential to be a practical means for evaluating internal muscle stresses during everyday life of individuals with paraplegia.

                Time-delay estimators, such as normalized cross correlation and phase-shift estimation, form the computational basis for elastography, blood flow measurements, and acoustic radiation force impulse ({ARFI}) imaging. This paper examines the performance of these algorithms for small displacements (less than half the ultrasound pulse wavelength). The effects of noise, bandwidth, stationary echoes, kernel size, downsampling, interpolation, and quadrature demodulation on the accuracy of the time delay estimates are measured in terms of bias and jitter. Particular attention is given to the accuracy and resolution of the displacement measurements and to the computational efficiency of the algorithms. In most cases, Loupas' two-dimensional ({2-D}) autocorrelator performs as well as the gold standard, normalized cross correlation. However, Loupas' algorithm's calculation time is significantly faster, and it is particularly suited to operate on the signal data format most commonly used in ultrasound scanners. These results are used to implement a real-time {ARFI} imaging system using a commercial ultrasound scanner and a computer cluster. Images processed with the algorithms are examined in an ex vivo liver ablation study.

                Supersonic shear imaging ({SSI}) is a new ultrasound-based technique for real-time visualization of soft tissue viscoelastic properties. Using ultrasonic focused beams, it is possible to remotely generate mechanical vibration sources radiating low-frequency, shear waves inside tissues. Relying on this concept, {SSI} proposes to create such a source and make it move at a supersonic speed. In analogy with the "sonic boom" created by a supersonic aircraft, the resulting shear waves will interfere constructively along a Mach cone, creating two intense plane shear waves. These waves propagate through the medium and are progressively distorted by tissue heterogeneities. An ultrafast scanner prototype is able to both generate this supersonic source and image (5000 frames/s) the propagation of the resulting shear waves. Using inversion algorithms, the shear elasticity of medium can be mapped quantitatively from this propagation movie. The {SSI} enables tissue elasticity mapping in less than 20 ms, even in strongly viscous medium like breast. Modalities such as shear compounding are implementable by tilting shear waves in different directions and improving the elasticity estimation. Results validating {SSI} in heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The first in vivo investigations made on healthy volunteers emphasize the potential clinical applicability of {SSI} for breast cancer detection.

    abstract = {The liver harvested from a donor must be preserved and transported to a suitable recipient immediately for a successful liver transplantation. In this process, the preservation period is the most critical, since it is the longest and most tissue damage occurs during this period due to the reduced blood supply to the harvested liver and the change in its temperature. We investigate the effect of preservation period on the dynamic material properties of bovine liver using a viscoelastic model derived from both impact and ramp and hold experiments. First, we measure the storage and loss moduli of bovine liver as a function of excitation frequency using an impact hammer. Second, its time-dependent relaxation modulus is measured separately through ramp and hold experiments performed by a compression device. Third, a Maxwell solid model that successfully imitates the frequency- and time-dependent dynamic responses of bovine liver is developed to estimate the optimum viscoelastic material coefficients by minimizing the error between the experimental data and the corresponding values generated by the model. Finally, the variation in the viscoelastic material coefficients of bovine liver are investigated as a function of preservation period for the liver samples tested 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h after harvesting. The results of our experiments performed with three animals show that the liver tissue becomes stiffer and more viscous as it spends more time in the preservation cycle.},

                Dynamic elastography ({DE}) is a new tool to study mechanical behavior of soft tissues via their motion response to propagating shear waves. This technique characterized viscoelasticity of 9 porcine whole blood samples (3 animals) during coagulation for a shearing frequency of {70Hz}, and after complete clot formation between 50 and {160Hz}. Clot storage (G') and loss (G″) moduli were calculated from shear wave velocity and attenuation. Temporal evolutions of G' and G″ during coagulation were typified with 4 parameters: maximum change in elasticity (G' slope(max)), elasticity after 120min of coagulation (G'(max)), time occurrence of G″ maximum (t(e)) and G″ at the plateau (G″(plateau)). G' and G″ frequency dependence of completely formed blood clots was fitted with 5 standard rheological models: Maxwell, {Kelvin-Voigt}, Jeffrey, Zener and third-order generalized Maxwell. {DE} had sufficient sensitivity to follow the coagulation kinetics described by a progressive increase in G', while G″ transitory increased followed by a rapid stabilization. Inter- and intra-animal dispersions ({InterAD} and {IntraAD}) of G'(max) ({InterAD}=15.9\%, {IntraAD}=9.1\%) showed better reproducibility than G' slope(max) ({InterAD}=40.4\%, {IntraAD}=21.9\%), t(e) ({InterAD}=27.4\%, {IntraAD}=18.7\%) and G″(plateau) ({InterAD}=58.6\%, {IntraAD}=40.2\%). G' evolution within the considered range of frequency exhibited an increase, followed by stabilization to a plateau, whereas G″ presented little variations with convergence at a quasi-constant value at highest frequencies. Residues χ(⁎), describing the goodness of fit between models and experimental data, showed statistically (p<0.05) that the {Kelvin-Voigt} model was less in agreement with experimental data than other models. The Zener model is recommended to predict G' and G″ dispersion of coagulated blood over the explored frequency range.

                It is well known that many biological soft tissues behave as viscoelastic materials with hysteresis curves being nearly independent of strain rate when loading frequency is varied over a large range. In this work, the rate-insensitive feature of biological materials is taken into account by a generalized Maxwell model. To minimize the number of model parameters, it is assumed that the characteristic frequencies of Maxwell elements form a geometric series. As a result, the model is characterized by five material constants: micro(0), tau, m, rho and beta, where micro(0) is the relaxed elastic modulus, tau the characteristic relaxation time, m the number of Maxwell elements, rho the gap between characteristic frequencies, and beta=micro(1)/micro(0) with micro(1) being the elastic modulus of the Maxwell body that has relaxation time tau. The physical basis of the model is motivated by the microstructural architecture of typical soft tissues. The novel model shows excellent fit of relaxation data on the canine aorta and captures the salient features of vascular viscoelasticity with significantly fewer model parameters.

                In this paper, we present measurements of the shear properties of porcine skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney and a novel model describing them. Following a previously used method, shear mechanical impedances are measured, and complex shear moduli are obtained in the frequency range 6-20 {MHz}. As indicated in previous results, negative storage moduli are obtained in some measurements, which yield negative shear moduli in traditional linear viscoelastic models such as the Maxwell model, the Voigt model, and the Kelvin model. To resolve this problem, we propose a simple extension of the Voigt model. A mass is introduced into the model to account for the extra phase shift that apparently produces the negative moduli, and the shear stress thereby is related to the inertia of the material. The observed negative storage moduli are predicted by the new model when the relaxation time of the material is large and the working frequency is high. The model is fitted to experimental data to obtain values for material constants.

                Elasticity imaging methods have been used to study tissue mechanical properties and have demonstrated that tissue elasticity changes with disease state. In current shear wave elasticity imaging methods typically only shear wave speed is measured and rheological models, e.g. {Kelvin-Voigt}, Maxwell and Standard Linear Solid, are used to solve for tissue mechanical properties such as the shear viscoelastic complex modulus. This paper presents a method to quantify viscoelastic material properties in a model-independent way by estimating the complex shear elastic modulus over a wide frequency range using time-dependent creep response induced by acoustic radiation force. This radiation force induced creep method uses a conversion formula that is the analytic solution of a constitutive equation. The proposed method in combination with shearwave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry is used to measure the complex modulus so that knowledge of the applied radiation force magnitude is not necessary. The conversion formula is shown to be sensitive to sampling frequency and the first reliable measure in time according to numerical simulations using the {Kelvin-Voigt} model creep strain and compliance. Representative model-free shear complex moduli from homogeneous tissue mimicking phantoms and one excised swine kidney were obtained. This work proposes a novel model-free ultrasound-based elasticity method that does not require a rheological model with associated fitting requirements.

@article{qiang11,
    abstract = {A two-step viscoelastic spherical indentation method is proposed to compensate for 1) material relaxation and 2) sample thickness. In the first step, the indenter is moved at a constant speed and the reaction force is measured. In the second step, the indenter is held at a constant position and the relaxation response of the material is measured. Then the relaxation response is fit with a multi-exponential function which corresponds to a three-branch general Maxwell model. The relaxation modulus is derived by correcting the finite ramp time introduced in the first step. The proposed model takes into account the sample thickness, which is important for applications in which the sample thickness is less than ten times the indenter radius. The model is validated numerically by finite element simulations. Experiments are carried out on a 10\% gelatin phantom and a chicken breast sample with the proposed method. The results for both the gelatin phantom and the chicken breast sample agree with the results obtained from a surface wave method. Both the finite element simulations and experimental results show improved elasticity estimations by incorporating the sample thickness into the model. The measured shear elasticities of the 10\% gelatin sample are 6.79 and 6.93 {kPa} by the proposed finite indentation method at sample thickness of 40 and 20 mm, respectively. The elasticity of the same sample is estimated to be 6.53 {kPa} by the surface wave method. For the chicken breast sample, the shear elasticity is measured to be 4.51 and 5.17 {kPa} by the proposed indentation method at sample thickness of 40 and 20 mm, respectively. Its elasticity is measured by the surface wave method to be 4.14 {kPa}.},

                Viscoelastic models are generally considered a good option for modeling biological tissue due to tissue time-dependency. However, although various forms of viscoelastic models have been developed, only a few have shown a good balance between model mathematical simplicity and experimental fit accuracy. Starting from a basic Standard Linear Solid ({SLS}) model, a systematic modification of the viscoelastic model leading to a more accurate tissue model is presented. A five-element model family, with a Double Maxwell-arm Wiechert ({DMW}) representative model, is selected for its mathematical simplicity and mathematical loading accuracy. This {DMW} model is then used to fit experimental data collected from stress relaxation indentation tests performed on fresh porcine liver and spleen. The results show that this {DMW} model provides a closer fit with the experimental liver ({SLS} R(2)=0.731, {DMW} R(2)=0.991) and spleen ({SLS} R(2)=0.720, {DMW} R(2)=0.981) data, compared to an {SLS} model, while maintaining appreciable mathematical simplicity by using only five model elements, compared to seven-element models. Thus, any model from this five-element model family can be used as a base compressive model for complex soft tissue with an approximate 35\% improved model fit over {SLS}. Finally, model element parameters for in vitro fresh porcine liver and spleen are determined from the associated indentation tests.

                Ultrasound vibrometry can measure the propagation velocity of shear waves in soft tissue noninvasively, and the shear moduli of tissue can be estimated inversely from the velocities at multiple frequencies. It is possible to choose the appropriate model for tissue characterization from mathematical methods and analysis of model behaviors. The three classic models, Voigt, Maxwell, and Zener, were applied to fit the velocity measurements and estimate shear moduli of porcine livers with different thermal damage levels and different storage times. The Zener model always provided the best estimation of the moduli with the minimum errors in our experiments. Unlike the Voigt and Maxwell models, the moduli of the Zener model cannot be used to indicate damage levels in porcine livers directly, but the creep and relaxation behaviors of the Zener model are effective.

                A tissue-mimicking material ({TMM}) for the acoustic and thermal characterization of high-intensity focused ultrasound ({HIFU}) devices has been developed. The material is a high-temperature hydrogel matrix (gellan gum) combined with different sizes of aluminum oxide particles and other chemicals. The ultrasonic properties (attenuation coefficient, speed of sound, acoustical impedance, and the thermal conductivity and diffusivity) were characterized as a function of temperature from 20 to {70°C}. The backscatter coefficient and nonlinearity parameter {B/A} were measured at room temperature. Importantly, the attenuation coefficient has essentially linear frequency dependence, as is the case for most mammalian tissues at {37°C}. The mean value is 0.64f(0.95) {dB}·cm(-1) at {20°C}, based on measurements from 2 to 8 {MHz}. Most of the other relevant physical parameters are also close to the reported values, although backscatter signals are low compared with typical human soft tissues. Repeatable and consistent temperature elevations of {40°C} were produced under 20-s {HIFU} exposures in the {TMM}. This {TMM} is appropriate for developing standardized dosimetry techniques, validating numerical models, and determining the safety and efficacy of {HIFU} devices.

                To identify specific demographic, medical, functional status, and nutritional characteristics that predict the development of stage 2 or greater pressure ulcers among patients whose activity is limited to bed or chair.
                Prospective inception cohort study.
                Tertiary care, urban, university teaching hospital.
                A total of 286 patients fulfilling the following criteria: admitted to the hospital within the previous 3 days, age 55 years or more, expected to be confined to bed or chair for at least 5 days or had a hip fracture, and without a stage 2 or greater pressure ulcer.
                Time to in-hospital development of a stage 2 or greater pressure ulcer.
                Total cumulative incidence of pressure ulcers was 12.9\% (n = 37) after a median time of 9 days from admission to final skin examination. Age of 75 years or more, dry skin, nonblanchable erythema (a stage 1 pressure ulcer), previous pressure ulcer history, immobility, fecal incontinence, depleted triceps skinfold, lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.50 x {10(9)/L}), and decreased body weight (< 58 kg) were significantly associated with pressure ulcer development by univariate {Kaplan-Meier} survival analyses (P < .05 by log-rank test). Risk ratios (and 95\% confidence intervals) for predictors (P < or = .05) of pressure ulcer development after multivariable Cox regression analysis included the following: nonblanchable erythema, 7.52 (1.00 to 59.12); lymphopenia, 4.86 (1.70 to 13.89); immobility, 2.36 (1.14 to 4.85); dry skin, 2.31 (1.02 to 5.21); and decreased body weight, 2.18 (1.05 to 4.52). The 3-week cumulative incidence of pressure ulcers with none, one, two, or three or more of these characteristics was 0\%, 11.4\%, 39.6\%, and 67.9\%, respectively (P < .001 by log-rank test).
                These results suggest that nonblanchable erythema, lymphopenia, immobility, dry skin, and decreased body weight are independent and significant risk factors for pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients whose activity is limited to bed or chair.

                The underlying mechanisms leading to deep tissue injury after sustained compressive loading are not well understood. It is hypothesized that initial damage to muscle fibers is induced mechanically by local excessive deformation. Therefore, in this study, an animal model was used to study early damage after compressive loading to elucidate on the damage mechanisms leading to deep pressure ulcers. The tibialis anterior of {Brown-Norway} rats was loaded for 2 h by means of an indenter. Experiments were performed in a magnetic resonance ({MR})-compatible loading device. Muscle tissue was evaluated with transverse relaxation time (T2)-weighted {MRI} both during loading and up to 20 h after load removal. In addition, a detailed examination of the histopathology was performed at several time points (1, 4, and 20 h) after unloading. Results demonstrated that, immediately after unloading, T2-weighted {MR} images showed localized areas with increased signal intensity. Histological examination at 1 and 4 h after unloading showed large necrotic regions with complete disorganization of the internal structure of the muscle fibers. Hypercontraction zones were found bilateral to the necrotic zone. Twenty hours after unloading, an extensive inflammatory response was observed. The proposed relevance of large deformation was demonstrated by the location of damage indicated by T2-weighted {MRI} and the histological appearance of the compressed tissues. Differences in damage development distal and proximal to the indenter position suggested a contribution of perfusion status in the measured tissue changes that, however, appeared be to reversible.

                General purpose computing on graphics processing units ({GPUs}) has been previously shown to speed up computationally intensive data processing and image reconstruction algorithms for computed tomography ({CT}), magnetic resonance ({MR}), and ultrasound images. Although some algorithms in ultrasound have been converted to {GPU} processing, many investigative ultrasound research systems still use serial processing on a single {CPU}. One such ultrasound modality is acoustic radiation force impulse ({ARFI}) imaging, which investigates the mechanical properties of soft tissue. Traditionally, the raw data are processed offline to estimate the displacement of the tissue after the application of radiation force. It is highly advantageous to process the data in real-time to assess their quality and make modifications during a study. In this paper, we present algorithms for efficient {GPU} parallel processing of two widely used tools in ultrasound: cubic spline interpolation and Loupas' two-dimensional autocorrelator for displacement estimation. It is shown that a commercially available graphics card can be used for these computations, achieving speed increases up to 40x compared with single {CPU} processing. Thus, we conclude that the {GPU}-based data processing approach facilitates real-time (i.e., <1 second) display of {ARFI} data and is a promising approach for ultrasonic research systems.

                Plaque rupture is the most common cause of complications such as stroke and coronary heart failure. Recent histopathological evidence suggests that several plaque features, including a large lipid core and a thin fibrous cap, are associated with plaques most at risk for rupture. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ({ARFI}) imaging, a recently developed ultrasound-based elasticity imaging technique, shows promise for imaging these features noninvasively. Clinically, this could be used to distinguish vulnerable plaques, for which surgical intervention may be required, from those less prone to rupture. In this study, a parametric analysis using Finite Element Method ({FEM}) models was performed to simulate {ARFI} imaging of five different carotid artery plaques across a wide range of material properties. It was demonstrated that {ARFI} imaging could resolve the softer lipid pool from the surrounding, stiffer media and fibrous cap and was most dependent upon the stiffness of the lipid pool component. Stress concentrations due to an {ARFI} excitation were located in the media and fibrous cap components. In all cases, the maximum Von Mises stress was<1.2 {kPa}. In comparing these results with others investigating plaque rupture, it is concluded that while the mechanisms may be different, the Von Mises stresses imposed by {ARFI} imaging are orders of magnitude lower than the stresses associated with blood pressure.

                A method of acoustic remote palpation, capable of imaging local variations in the mechanical properties of tissue, is under investigation. In this method, focused ultrasound is used to apply localized (on the order of 2 mm3) radiation force within tissue. and the resulting tissue displacements are mapped using ultrasonic correlation based methods. The tissue displacements are inversely proportional to the stiffness of the tissue, and thus a stiffer region of tissue exhibits smaller displacements than a more compliant region. In this paper, the feasibility of remote palpation is demonstrated experimentally using breast tissue phantoms with spherical lesion inclusions, and in vitro liver samples. A single diagnostic transducer and modified ultrasonic imaging system are used to perform remote palpation. The displacement images are directly correlated to local variations in tissue stiffness with higher contrast than the corresponding B-mode images. Relationships between acoustic beam parameters, lesion characteristics and radiation force induced tissue displacement patterns are investigated and discussed. The results show promise for the clinical implementation of remote palpation.

                The evaluation of lesions in the gastrointestinal ({GI}) tract using ultrasound can suffer from poor contrast between healthy and diseased tissue. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ({ARFI}) imaging provides information about the mechanical properties of tissue using brief, high-intensity, focused ultrasound to generate radiation force and ultrasonic correlation-based methods to track the resulting tissue displacement. Using conventional linear arrays, {ARFI} imaging has shown improved contrast over B-mode images when applied to solid masses in the breast and liver. The purpose of this work is to (1) investigate the potential for {ARFI} imaging to provide improvements over conventional B-mode imaging of {GI} lesions and (2) demonstrate that {ARFI} imaging can be performed with an endocavity probe. {ARFI} images of an adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal ({GE}) junction, status-post chemotherapy and radiation treatment, demonstrate better contrast between healthy and fibrotic/malignant tissue than standard B-mode images. {ARFI} images of healthy gastric, esophageal, and colonic tissue specimens differentiate normal anatomic tissue layers (i.e., mucosal, muscularis and adventitial layers), as confirmed by histologic evaluation. {ARFI} imaging of ex vivo colon and small bowel tumors portray interesting contrast and structure that are not as well defined in B-mode images. An endocavity probe created {ARFI} images to a depth of over 2 cm in tissue-mimicking phantoms, with maximum displacements of 4 microm. These findings support the clinical feasibility of endocavity {ARFI} imaging to guide diagnosis and staging of disease processes in the {GI} tract.

                Pressure ulcers are areas of soft tissue breakdown that result from sustained mechanical loading of the skin and underlying tissues; they can affect the quality of life of many individuals. Despite considerable efforts to prevent pressure ulcers, data on prevalence are unacceptably high. This can at least partly be attributed to limited knowledge of the etiology of the clinical condition and the fact that identification and prevention of pressure ulcers mainly focus on skin tissue, even though the underlying muscle tissue may be more susceptible to mechanical loading. The present article proposes a new, hierarchical research approach to obtain improved insights into the basic pathways whereby mechanical loading leads to soft tissue breakdown. This approach investigates the relationships between (1) global mechanical loading at skin level, (2) the resulting local internal mechanical conditions within the soft tissue layers extending from skin to muscle tissue, and (3) the pathophysiologic response to loading. The latter response should be assessed from the various functional tissue units involved in soft-tissue breakdown-the cells, the interstitial space, and blood and lymph vessels. We predict that the proposed strategy will provide new fundamental knowledge about the etiology of pressure ulcers that can serve as a sound basis for effective clinical identification and prevention.

@article{jin05,
    abstract = {The effects of acoustic heterogeneities on transcranial brain imaging with microwave-induced thermoacoustic tomography were studied. A numerical model for calculating the propagation of thermoacoustic waves through the skull was developed and experimentally examined. The model takes into account wave reflection and refraction at the skull surfaces and therefore provides improved accuracy for the reconstruction. To evaluate when the skull-induced effects could be ignored in reconstruction, the reconstructed images obtained by the proposed method were further compared with those obtained with the method based on homogeneous acoustic properties. From simulation and experimental results, it was found that when the target region is close to the center of the brain, the effects caused by the skull layer are minimal and both reconstruction methods work well. As the target region becomes closer to the interface between the skull and brain tissue, however, the skull-induced distortion becomes increasingly severe, and the reconstructed image would be strongly distorted without correcting those effects. In this case, the proposed numerical method can improve image quality by taking into consideration the wave refraction and mode conversion at the skull surfaces. This work is important for obtaining good brain images when the thickness of the skull cannot be ignored.},

                This study describes the sequential histopathological changes that occur in the development of pressure ulcers experimentally induced in the fuzzy rat model. Computer-controlled pressure was applied for six hours at a maximum of five sessions, to skin over the greater trochanter of anesthetized rats. Lesions were similar, but more pronounced after the third, fourth, and fifth sessions as compared to the first or second sessions. Lesions developed first in the muscle rather than the dermis or epidermis. The lesion most often associated with pressure was necrosis of the panniculus carnosus muscle, often accompanied by damage to underlying adipose tissue. Recurrent pressure results in increasingly severe damage to the vascular system and parenchyma, consistent with an ischemia/reperfusion insult initiated through a free radical mechanism.

                The subjects were 43 men with {SCI} between C5 and L1 (age: 42.6+/-11.6 years, mean+/-s.d.). A total of 129 areas (sacral region and bilateral ischial regions in each subject) were examined by inspection, palpation and ultrasonography.
                Of the 129 areas, 112 were normal by inspection, palpation and ultrasound imaging. Nine areas were abnormal on ultrasonography alone and six were lesion positive by palpation and ultrasonography. Only two areas were abnormal by all three methods. Ultrasonography always detected a heterogeneous pattern and low-echoic areas directly adjacent to the bone.
                Our results indicated that low-echoic lesions, signaling deep tissue injuries or early pressure ulcers, originated in areas near the bone and extended toward the epidermis. The results suggest that ultrasonography is a useful tool for the early detection of deep tissue injuries or pressure ulcers.

                The investigators identified 32 grants, representing 16,444,117 {US} dollars in research funding. The majority of this funding came from federal sources, including the National Institutes of Health (90\%), the Department of Veterans Affairs (7\%), the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (2\%), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1\%). One quarter of pressure ulcer research grants related to quality improvement. Additional topic areas included risk factors or risk assessment tools (19\%), adjunctive therapy (16\%), mobilization (13\%), and pressure management in foot care for patients with diabetes mellitus (9\%). Further grants were in the areas of incidence, assessing tissue damage or healing, support surfaces, dressings and topical agents, nutrition, economic evaluation, and pain.
                The investment in pressure ulcer research is minute compared with pressure ulcer treatment expenditures. Policy makers are urged to encourage increased federal and foundation funding for research concerning pressure ulcers. Researchers are also encouraged to develop well-designed proposals to obtain available research funding. Additional research is needed in the areas of pressure ulcer incidence and prevalence, support surface design and use, pain, operative treatment, economic impact, and education strategies for caregivers and patients.

                The main signal-processing techniques used in elastography compute strains as the displacement derivative. They perform well for very low deformations, but suffer rapidly from decorrelation noise. Aiming to increase the range of accurate strain measurements, we developed an adaptive method based on the estimation of strains as local scaling factors. Its adaptability makes this method appropriate for computing scaling factors resulting from larger strains or a wide spread of strain variations. First, segments corresponding to the same part of tissue are adaptively selected in the rest and stressed state echo signals. Then, local scaling factors are estimated by iteratively varying their values until reaching the zero of the phase of the complex cross-correlation function. Results from simulation and from experimental data are presented. They show how this adaptive method can track various local deformations and its accuracy for strain up to 7\%.

                Purpose: Quantification of stiffness changes may provide important diagnostic information and aid in the early detection of cancers. Shear wave elastography is an imaging technique that assesses tissue stiffness using acoustic radiation force as an alternate to manual palpation reported previously with quasistatic elastography. In this study, the elastic properties of tissue mimicking materials, including agar, polyacrylamide ({PAA}), and silicone, are evaluated with an objective to determine material characteristics which resemble normal and cancerous prostate {tissue.Methods}: Acoustic properties and stiffness of tissue mimicking phantoms were measured using compressional mechanical testing and shear wave elastography using supersonic shear imaging. The latter is based on the principles of shear waves generated using acoustic radiation force. The evaluation included tissue mimicking materials ({TMMs}) within the prostate at different positions and sizes that could mimic cancerous and normal prostate tissue. Patient data on normal and prostate cancer tissues quantified using biopsy histopathology were used to validate the findings. Pathologist reports on histopathology were blinded to mechanical testing and elastographic {findings.Results}: Young's modulus values of 86.2 ± 4.5 and 271.5 ± 25.7 {kPa} were obtained for {PAA} mixed with 2\% {Al(2)O}(3) particles and silicone, respectively. Young's modulus of {TMMs} from mechanical compression testing showed a clear trend of increasing stiffness with an increasing percentage of agar. The silicone material had higher stiffness values when compared with {PAA} with {Al(2)O}(3). The mean Young's modulus value in cancerous tissue was 90.5 ± 4.5 {kPa} as compared to 93.8 ± 4.4 and 86.2 ± 4.5 {kPa} obtained with {PAA} with 2\% {Al(2)O}(3) phantom at a depth of 52.4 and 36.6 mm, {respectively.Conclusions}: {PAA} mixed with {Al(2)O}(3) provides the most suitable tissue mimicking material for prostate cancer tumor material, while agar could form the surrounding background to simulate normal prostate tissue.

                A pressure ulcer is a localised injury of the skin and underlying tissue that usually develops over a bony prominence. A decrease in the pressure over the bony prominence effectively prevents pressure ulcers; however, no studies have systematically assessed the physical properties of existing pressure ulcers. To characterise pressure ulcers, we established new terminology that clarifies the physical properties of pressure ulcers: wound mobility was defined as movement using the bony prominence as a predefined specific marker, and wound deformity was defined as a change in the three-dimensional shape of the wound. Observational studies using this terminology showed that the distinct physical properties of pressure ulcers depend on the site of development and the wound depth according to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel criteria. Most grade {IV} sacrum pressure ulcers exhibited mobility and deformity. Superficial sacrum pressure ulcers below grade {II} showed only mobility. In contrast, foot pressure ulcers did not exhibit mobility or deformity. We propose a new concept, 'wound physical property', for understanding the unique pathogenesis of pressure ulcers.

                Several groups are studying acoustic radiation force and its ability to image the mechanical properties of tissue. Acoustic radiation force impulse ({ARFI}) imaging is one modality using standard diagnostic ultrasound scanners to generate localized, impulsive, acoustic radiation forces in tissue. The dynamic response of tissue is measured via conventional ultrasonic speckle-tracking methods and provides information about the mechanical properties of tissue. A finite-element method ({FEM}) model has been developed that simulates the dynamic response of tissues, with and without spherical inclusions, to an impulsive acoustic radiation force excitation from a linear array transducer. These {FEM} models were validated with calibrated phantoms. Shear wave speed, and therefore elasticity, dictates tissue relaxation following {ARFI} excitation, but Poisson's ratio and density do not significantly alter tissue relaxation rates. Increased acoustic attenuation in tissue increases the relative amount of tissue displacement in the near field compared with the focal depth, but relaxation rates are not altered. Applications of this model include improving image quality, and distilling material and structural information from tissue's dynamic response to {ARFI} excitation. Future work on these models includes incorporation of viscous material properties and modeling the ultrasonic tracking of displaced scatterers.

                The early detection of breast cancer reduces patient mortality. The most common method of breast cancer detection is palpation. However, lesions that lie deep within the breast are difficult to palpate when they are small. Thus, a method of remote palpation, which may allow the detection of small lesions lying deep within the breast, is currently under investigation. In this method, acoustic radiation force is used to apply localized forces within tissue (to tissue volumes on the order of 2 mm3) and the resulting tissue displacements are mapped using ultrasonic correlation based methods. A volume of tissue that is stiffer than the surrounding medium (i.e., a lesion) distributes the force throughout the tissue beneath it, resulting in larger regions of displacement, and smaller maximum displacements. The resulting displacement maps may be used to image tissue stiffness. A finite-element-model ({FEM}) of acoustic remote palpation is presented in this paper. Using this model, a parametric analysis of the affect of varying tissue and acoustic beam characteristics on radiation force induced tissue displacements is performed. The results are used to evaluate the potential of acoustic remote palpation to provide useful diagnostic information in a clinical setting. The potential for using a single diagnostic transducer to both generate radiation force and track the resulting displacements is investigated.

                Streaming detection is an ultrasonic technique that can be used to distinguish fluid-filled lesions, or cysts, from solid lesions. With this technique, high intensity ultrasound pulses are used to induce acoustic streaming in cyst fluid, and this motion is detected using Doppler flow estimation methods. Results from a pilot clinical study were recently published in which acoustic streaming was successfully induced and detected in 14 of 15 simple breast cysts and four of 14 sonographically indeterminate breast lesions in vivo. In the study, the detected velocities were found to vary considerably among cysts and for different pulsing regimes. A finite element model of streaming detection is presented. This model is utilized to investigate methods of increasing induced acoustic streaming velocity while minimizing patient exposure to high intensity ultrasound during streaming detection. Parameters studied include intensity, frequency, acoustic beam shape, cyst-diameter, cyst fluid protein concentration, and cyst fluid viscosity. The model, which provides both transient and steady-state solutions, is shown to predict trends in streaming velocity accurately. Experimental results from studies investigating the potential for nonlinear streaming enhancement in cysts are also provided.

                Determinations of shear wave speeds of sound and attenuation coefficients are reported for soft tissues, a silicone rubber reference material, and a gel used in manufacturing ultrasonically tissue-mimicking materials. Fresh bovine tissues were investigated, including calfskin, liver, cardiac muscle, and striated muscle. Because of the very large shear wave attenuation coefficients, reasonably accurate determinations of shear wave properties are difficult to make. The quantity measured directly was the complex reflection coefficient for shear waves at a planar interface between the sample and fused silica. Measurements were made at frequencies spanning the range 2-14 {MHz}. The shear wave attenuation coefficients increase with frequency and are of the order of 10(4) times the longitudinal wave attenuation coefficients. The shear wave speeds of sound also increase with frequency but are only a few percent of the longitudinal wave speeds of sound. The results are accurate enough to allow frequency dependencies to be proposed.

                The perceived association between dietary cholesterol ({DC}) and risk for coronary heart disease ({CHD}) has resulted in recommendations of no more than 300 mg/d for healthy persons in the United States. These dietary recommendations proposed in the 1960s had little scientific evidence other than the known association between saturated fat and cholesterol and animal studies where cholesterol was fed in amounts far exceeding normal intakes. In contrast, European countries, Asian countries, and Canada do not have an upper limit for {DC}. Further, current epidemiologic data have clearly demonstrated that increasing concentrations of {DC} are not correlated with increased risk for {CHD}. Clinical studies have shown that even if {DC} may increase plasma low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol in certain individuals (hyper-responders), this is always accompanied by increases in high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol, so the {LDL}/{HDL} cholesterol ratio is maintained. More importantly, {DC} reduces circulating levels of small, dense {LDL} particles, a well-defined risk factor for {CHD}. This article presents recent evidence from human studies documenting the lack of effect of {DC} on {CHD} risk, suggesting that guidelines for {DC} should be revisited.

                Basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research on carbohydrate-restricted dietary patterns continues to grow, evaluating the impact of this way of eating on weight loss, obesity-associated comorbidities, and development of any adverse effects. Randomized, controlled, dietary weight loss trials conducted in adults in the past 2 years reinforce previous findings that carbohydrate-restricted diets ({CRDs}) promote weight loss while increasing serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lowering serum triglycerides, and improving glucose homeostasis. Studies showing that reduction of dietary carbohydrate leads to reduced postprandial serum glucose and insulin levels have spurred further research on {CRDs} in patients with type 2 diabetes. Emerging interest into the effect of diet on endothelial function has spawned studies that are harnessing new technologies, such as flow-mediated vascular dilation, to gain insight into the impact of diet on long-term cardiovascular disease outcomes. Studies on the effect of a {CRD} on appetite, health-related quality of life, bone density and turnover, acid-base metabolism, and potassium equilibrium help clinicians better weigh the perceived risks of the diet with the recognized benefits. This review synthesizes important clinical and physiologic studies on {CRDs} published between January 2007 and May 2009.

    abstract = {Pressure sores affecting muscles are severe injuries associated with ischemia, impaired metabolic activity, excessive tissue deformation, and insufficient lymph drainage caused by prolonged and intensive mechanical loads. We hypothesize that mechanical properties of muscle tissue change as a result of exposure to prolonged and intensive loads. Such changes may affect the distribution of stresses in soft tissues under bony prominences and potentially expose additional uninjured regions of muscle tissue to intensified stresses. In this study, we characterized changes in tangent elastic moduli and strain energy densities of rat gracilis muscles exposed to pressure in vivo (11.5, 35, or 70 {kPa} for 2, 4, or 6 h) and incorporated the abnormal properties that were measured in finite element models of the head, shoulders, pelvis, and heels of a recumbent patient. Using in vitro uniaxial tension testing, we found that tangent elastic moduli of muscles exposed to 35 and 70 {kPa} were 1.6-fold those of controls (P < 0.05, for strains </=5\%) and strain energy densities were 1.4-fold those of controls (P < 0.05, for strains >/=5\%). Histological (phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin) evaluation showed that this stiffening accompanied extensive necrotic damage. Incorporating these effects into the finite element models, we were able to show that the increased muscle stiffness in widening regions results in elevated tissue stresses that exacerbate the potential for tissue necrosis. Interfacial pressures could not predict deep muscle (e.g., longissimus or gluteus) stresses and injuring conditions. We conclude that information on internal muscle stresses is required to establish new criteria for pressure sore prevention.},

                The abnormally elevated plantar pressures under the bony prominences of the diabetic foot (mainly under the medial metatarsal heads and calcaneus) were associated with intensified internal stresses in the deep soft tissues padding these bones. In this study, we tested changes in mechanical properties of muscular tissue after exposure to the internal stress levels typically developing under the first and second metatarsal heads in the load bearing diabetic foot (40-80 {KPa}). The gracilis muscles of anesthetized rats were subjected to constant external pressures of 35 and 70 {KPa} for 2 h, which caused average internal compression stresses of 40 and 80 {KPa}, respectively, within the living gracilis. The animals were then killed and the tangent elastic moduli of the harvested gracilis were measured in uniaxial tension at strains of 2.5\%, 5\% and 7.5\%. Tangent moduli of gracilis muscles exposed to internal compression of 40-80 {KPa} in vivo ( n=6) were 1.6-fold stiffer ( p<0.05) than those of controls ( n=6). These abnormally stiff mechanical properties were incorporated into a finite element ({FE}) model of the plantar tissue under the second ray of the foot, and were shown to increase the magnitude of deep internal stresses and project elevated stresses to larger regions. Hence, the integration of animal model data with {FE} simulations indicates a mechanism of plantar tissue deterioration in the diabetic foot, where muscles exposed to critical stresses respond with increased stiffness which then further intensifies the deep plantar stresses. This suggests a new positive feedback mechanism for the diffusion of ulcers and the atrophy of intrinsic plantar muscles in the diabetic foot, where the injury spreads from deep muscles to the skin surface by an evolving mechanical stress wave.

                Pressure-related deep tissue injury is the term recommended by the United States National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel to describe a potentially life-threatening form of pressure ulcers, characterized by the presence of necrotic tissue under intact skin, and associated with prolonged compression of muscle tissue under bony prominences. In this study, a theoretical model was used to determine the relative contributions of the backrest inclination angle during prolonged wheelchair sitting, the muscle tissue stiffness and curvature of the ischial tuberosities ({ITs}) to the risk for injury in the gluteus muscles that pad the {IT} bones during sitting. The model is based on Hertz's theory for analysis of contact pressures between a rigid half-sphere (bone) and an elastic half-space (muscle). Hertz's theory is coupled with an injury threshold and damage law for muscle-both obtained in previous studies in rats. The simulation outputs the time-dependent bone-muscle contact pressures and the injured area in the gluteus. We calculated the full-size (asymptotic) injured area in the gluteus and the time for injury onset for different sitting angles alpha (90-150 degrees), muscle tissue long-term shear moduli G (250-1,200 Pa) and bone diameters D (8-18 mm). We then evaluated the sensitivity of model results to variations in these parameters, in order to determine how injury predictions are affected. In reclined sitting (alpha=150 degrees) the full-size injured area was approximately 2.1-fold smaller and the time for injury onset was approximately 1.3-fold longer compared with erect sitting (alpha=90 degrees). For greater G the full-size injured area was smaller but the time for injury onset was shorter, e.g., increasing G from 250 to 1200 Pa decreased the full-size injured area approximately 2.5-fold, but shortened the time for injury onset 6.2-fold. For smaller D the time for injury onset dropped, e.g., decreased approximately 1.5-fold when D decreased from 18 to 8 mm. Interestingly, the full-size injured area maximized at D of about 12 mm but decreased for smaller or larger D. The susceptibility to sitting-acquired deep tissue injury strongly depends on the geometrical and biomechanical characteristics of the bone-muscle interface, and, particularly, on the radius of curvature of the {IT} which mostly influenced the size of the wound, and on the muscle stiffness which dominantly affected the time for injury onset.

                Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ({CMML}) is a clinically heterogeneous disease, with no standard treatment. We present the outcome of ten patients diagnosed with {CMML} and treated with {AZA} in our institutions between 2005 and 2010. All patients were transfusion dependent at the time of initiation of therapy. The overall response rate was 60\%. Responses were obtained in 2/3 of the patients with proliferative {CMML}. The median survival from start of therapy was 20 months. {AZA} treatment was well-tolerated and associated with a significant response rate in all forms of the disease.

                Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms ({t-MN}), including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia ({t-MDS} and {t-AML}) are associated to clinical and biologic unfavorable prognostic features, including high levels of {DNA} methylation.
                We retrospectively evaluated 50 {t-MN} patients (34 {MDS} and 16 {AML}) selected among all patients receiving azacitidine ({AZA}) at 10 Italian Hematology Centers. Patients had developed a {t-MN} at a median of 6.5 years (range 1.7- 29) after treatment of the primary tumor (hematological neoplasm, 27 patients; solid tumor, 23 patients).
                The overall response rate was 42\% (complete remission: 10 patients, partial remission: 2 and hematological improvement: 8 patients) and was obtained after a median of 3 cycles (range 1-6). Median overall survival ({OS}) was 21 months (range 1-53.6+) from {AZA} start. {OS} was significantly better in patients with less than 20\% blasts, in normal karyotype {t-AML} and when {AZA} was used as front-line treatment. This was confirmed by the multivariate analysis.
                This study reports efficacy of {AZA} in the largest series of therapy-related {MN} patients treated with {5-AZA}. Our data show that blasts and karyotype maintain their important prognostic role in {t-MN} also in the azacitidine era.

                Each year, one-fourth of the 200,000 individuals with spinal cord injury in the United States develop pressure ulcers. No method currently exists, however, to accurately identify which of these individuals are at increased risk for development of pressure ulcers. We studied 219 spinal cord-injured patients, seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, during a 6-yr period. Our goal was to develop a pressure ulcer risk assessment scale, specifically for persons with {SCI}. Each risk factor had to meet four criteria: (1) statistical association with pressure ulcer development; (2) biologically plausible mechanism; (3) literature support; (4) improved prediction. Among the 219 spinal cord-injured patients evaluated, 176 (80.4 percent) had a history of one or more pressure ulcers. Fifteen risk factors met the four criteria for inclusion into the risk assessment scale. They were as follows: restricted activity level, degree of immobility, complete spinal cord injury, urinary disease, impaired cognitive function, diabetes, cigarette smoking, residence in a nursing home or hospital, hypoalbuminemia, and anemia. Compared with the more general scales available, for quantifying the risk of pressure ulcer development, preliminary results suggest that this new scale is a significant improvement for the spinal cord-disabled.

                Quantification of object elasticity properties has significant technical implications as well as important practical applications, such as medical disease diagnosis. In general, given noisy measurements on the kinematic states of the objects from imaging data, the aim is to recover the elasticity parameters for assumed material constitutive models of the objects. The implementation is complicated caused by the large dimensionality of the parameters.
                Various versions of the least-square ({LS}) methods have been widely used, which, however, do not perform well under reasonably realistic levels of disturbances. Another popular strategy, based on the extended Kalman filter ({EKF}), is also far from optimal and subject to divergence if either the initializations are poor or the noises are not Gaussian. In this paper, the authors propose a robust system identification paradigm for the quantitative analysis of object elasticity. It is derived and extended from the H(∞) filtering principles and is particularly powerful for real-world situations where the types and levels of the disturbances are unknown.
                Using synthetic data, the authors investigate the sensitivity of the strategies toward different types (Gaussian and Poisson) and levels of noises, as well as various initializations. The experimental results show consistently superior performance of the proposed method over the {LS} and {EKF} algorithms in reliably identifying object elastic modulus distributions.
                Results from phase contrast imaging data of canine hearts and human {MRI} data are also presented, which demonstrate the power of the framework.

                Elastography is emerging as an imaging modality that can distinguish normal versus diseased tissues via their biomechanical properties. This paper reviews current approaches to elastography in three areas--quasi-static, harmonic and transient--and describes inversion schemes for each elastographic imaging approach. Approaches include first-order approximation methods; direct and iterative inversion schemes for linear elastic; isotropic materials and advanced reconstruction methods for recovering parameters that characterize complex mechanical behavior. The paper's objective is to document efforts to develop elastography within the framework of solving an inverse problem, so that elastography may provide reliable estimates of shear modulus and other mechanical parameters. We discuss issues that must be addressed if model-based elastography is to become the prevailing approach to quasi-static, harmonic and transient elastography: (1) developing practical techniques to transform the ill-posed problem with a well-posed one; (2) devising better forward models to capture the complex mechanical behavior of soft tissues and (3) developing better test procedures to evaluate the performance of modulus elastograms.

                Five 9 cm x 9 cm x 9 cm phantoms, each with a 2-cm-diameter cylindrical inclusion, were produced with various dry-weight concentrations of agar and gelatin. Elastic contrasts ranged from 1.5 to 4.6, and values of the storage modulus (real part of the complex Young's modulus) were all in the soft tissue range. Additives assured immunity from bacterial invasion and can produce tissue-mimicking ultrasound and {NMR} properties. Monitoring of strain ratios over a 7 to 10 month period indicated that the mechanical properties of the phantoms were stable, allowing about 1 month for the phantom to reach chemical equilibrium. The only dependable method for determining the storage moduli of the inclusions is to make measurements on samples excised from the phantoms. If it is desired to produce and accurately characterize a phantom with small inclusions with other shapes, such as an array of small spheres, an auxiliary phantom with the geometry of the cylindrical inclusion phantoms or the equivalent should be made at the same time using the same materials. The elastic contrast can then be determined using samples excised from the auxiliary phantom. A small increase of about 10\% in volume of the cylindrical inclusions occurred-a tolerable increase. Interestingly, the smallest increase (about 5\%) occurred in the phantom with the largest elastic contrast.

                The development of phantom materials for elasticity imaging is reported in this paper. These materials were specifically designed to provide nonlinear stress/strain relationship that can be controlled independently of the small strain shear modulus of the material. The materials are mixtures of agar and gelatin gels. Oil droplet dispersions in these materials provide further control of the small strain shear modulus and the nonlinear parameter of the material. Since these materials are mostly water, they are assumed to be incompressible under typical experimental conditions in elasticity imaging. The {Veronda-Westman} model for strain energy density provided a good fit to all materials used in this study. Materials with a constant gelatin concentration (3.0\% dry weight) but varying agar concentration (0.6-2.8\% dry weight) demonstrated the same power law relationship between elastic modulus and agar concentration found for pure agar (1.89 +/- 0.02), consistent with percolation theory, and provided a consistent nonlinearity parameter of 4.5 +/- 0.3. The insights provided by this study will form the basis for stable elastography phantoms with stiffness and nonlinear stress/strain relationships in the background that differ from those in the target.

                Deep pressure ulcers, necessarily involving deep tissue injury ({DTI}), arise in the muscle layers adjacent to bony prominences because of sustained loading. They represent a serious type of pressure ulcer because they start in underlying tissues and are often not visible until they reach an advanced stage, at which time treatment becomes problematic. Underlying mechanisms of {DTI} require further investigation if appropriate preventive measures are to be determined. The present commentary illustrates a hierarchic research approach selected to study these mechanisms. To differentiate between the individual roles of deformation and ischemia in the onset of skeletal muscle damage, 2 complementary approaches have been selected. In an in vivo animal model, the effects of ischemia combined with deformation and ischemia per se were studied. An in vitro muscle model was used to study the separate effects of deformation and several aspects of ischemia, including hypoxia, glucose depletion, and tissue acidification, in more detail. Based on the results of both models a sequence of events leading to cell necrosis is proposed. Deformation levels exceeding a threshold value can result in rapid tissue damage that may persist, whereas ischemia has a more gradual effect as a result of glucose depletion and tissue acidification.

    abstract = {
                The phrasing of the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel's ({NPUAP}) definition of deep tissue injury ({DTI}) was based on case reports, clinical observations, and experience. Although etiological studies of {DTI}, primarily related to characterizing biomechanical factors affecting onset and progression, support and strengthen parts of the {NPUAP}'s definition, some recent findings suggest a need to re-evaluate the wording and perhaps refine future definitions of {DTI}. Application of existing bioengineering research to underlying biological, physical, biomechanical, and biochemical mechanisms involved in the definition of {DTI} suggests the following: 1) changes in skin color - ie, deviation of the local skin color from the surroundings - may indicate a {DTI} might be present, but color is not useful for quantifying the severity of injury; 2) the pressure and/or shear definition is inaccurate because it creates an artificial distinction between pressure and shear, which are physically coupled, and because it ignores tensional loads; 3) palpating tissue firmness at the wound site provides limited assessment information because tissue firmness will depend on the point in time along the course of {DTI} development. Damaged tissues might appear stiffer than surrounding tissues if examined when muscle tissue is locally contracted due to local rigor mortis but at a later stage damage might manifest as tissues that are softer than their surroundings when digestive enzymes start decomposing necrotic tissues; 4) skin temperature changes near the {DTI} site may reflect inflammatory response, causing local heating, or ischemic perfusion, causing local cooling; and 5) rapid deterioration of {DTI} is likely occurring due to muscle tissue stiffening at the rigor mortis phase; stiffened tissues abnormally deform adjacent tissues and this effect is amplified if muscles are atrophied. The application of interdisciplinary research may help clinicians and researchers move from evolving jargons, staging systems, and injury definitions to valid and reliable clinical instruments, which will improve clinical practice.

    abstract = {The overall goal of this project is to develop interventions for the prevention of deep tissue injury ({DTI}), a form of pressure ulcers that originates in deep tissue around bony prominences. The present study focused on: (1) obtaining detailed measures of the distribution of pressure experienced by tissue around the ischial tuberosities, and (2) investigating the effectiveness of intermittent electrical stimulation ({IES}), a novel strategy for the prevention of {DTI}, in alleviating pressure in regions at risk of breakdown due to sustained loading. The experiments were conducted in adult pigs. Five animals had intact spinal cords and healthy muscles and one had a spinal cord injury that led to substantial muscle atrophy at the time of the experiment. A force-controlled servomotor was used to load the region of the buttocks to levels corresponding to 25\%, 50\% or 75\% of each animal's body weight. A pressure transducer embedded in a catheter was advanced into the tissue to measure pressure along a three dimensional grid around the ischial tuberosity of one hind leg. For all levels of external loading in intact animals, average peak internal pressure was 2.01 ± 0.08 times larger than the maximal interfacial pressure measured at the level of the skin. In the animal with spinal cord injury, similar absolute values of internal pressure as that in intact animals were recorded, but the substantial muscle atrophy produced larger maximal interfacial pressures. Average peak internal pressure in this animal was 1.43 ± 0.055 times larger than the maximal interfacial pressure. Peak internal pressure was localized within a ±2 cm region medio-laterally and dorso-ventrally from the bone in intact animals and ±1 cm in the animal with spinal cord injury. {IES} significantly redistributed internal pressure, shifting the peak values away from the bone in spinally intact and injured animals. These findings provide critical information regarding the relationship between internal and interfacial pressure around the ischial tuberosities during loading levels equivalent to those experienced while sitting. The information could guide future computer models investigating the etiology of {DTI}, as well as inform the design and prescription of seating cushions for people with reduced mobility. The findings also suggest that {IES} may be an effective strategy for the prevention of {DTI}.},

    abstract = {Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a type of pressure ulcer in which tissue breakdown initiates at the bone-muscle interface under intact skin. Excessive deformation in the soft tissue, particularly around bony prominences, is believed to be one of the causes leading to the development of {DTI}. The main goal of this study was to measure the magnitude and distribution of strains within muscles surrounding the ischial tuberosities, induced by levels of external loading that encompass the range of loading experienced by the soft tissue in seated individuals. The experiments were conducted in adult pigs with intact spinal cords (n = 5) and pigs with partial spinal cord injury ({SCI}) (n = 2), one of which also had a {DTI}. A secondary goal was to obtain a preliminary assessment regarding the capacity of intermittent electrical stimulation ({IES}), an intervention for preventing the formation of {DTI}, to counteract the muscle compression caused by external loading. In intact animals, muscles subjected to external loads equivalent to 25\% of body weight experienced maximal principal strains, minimal principal strains, and shear strains of 0.68, -0.3, and 0.4, respectively. These magnitudes increased by 91.9, 17.6, and 87.5\%, respectively, when external loading increased to 50\% body weight. Minimal to no further increases in strain magnitudes were seen with the 75\% body weight loading level. In one animal with {SCI} and no {DTI}, strain magnitudes were on average 9.7\% higher than those in the intact animals at the corresponding loading levels. The presence of a {DTI} in another animal with {SCI} reduced strain magnitudes by 28\% compared to intact animals. The regions in the muscle that underwent the largest deformations were those between the ischial tuberosity and the external surface, and up to 2 cm ventral to the ischial tuberosity (furthest measured). Muscle contractions produced by {IES} increased the thickness of the tissue between the ischial tuberosities and skin during the period of stimulation by 10-20\% for loading levels up to 75\% of body weight in both intact and spinal cord injured pigs. This study provides the first measurements of strain around the ischial tuberosities in an animal model that resembles humans.},

                The present study characterizes the mechanical properties of polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA}) cryogel in order to show its utility for intravascular elastography. {PVA} cryogel becomes harder with an increasing number of freeze-thaw cycles, and Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are measured for seven samples. Mechanical tests were performed on cylindrical samples with a pressure column and on a hollow cylinder with the calculation of an intravascular elastogram. An image of the Young's modulus was obtained from the elastogram using cylinder geometry properties. Results show the mechanical similitude of {PVA} cryogel with the biological tissues present in arteries. A good agreement between Young's modulus obtained from pressure column and from elastogram was also observed.

                The aim of this study was to determine the characteristic of muscle crush injury at quantitative ultrasonographic elastography using supersonic shear imaging ({SSI}). Twenty-three New Zealand rabbits underwent crush injury to left hind leg caused by a special balloon cuff device. Conventional ultrasonography and {SSI} quantitative elastography were performed at both crushed and uncrushed regions of the left hind legs. Quantitative lesion elasticity was measured using the Young's modulus (in kilopascals) at 0.5 h, 2 h, 6 h, 24 h and 72 h after the release of the crushing pressure. Compared with those from the uncrushed regions, both the maximum and mean elasticity values at these time points from the crushed regions were significantly higher (p < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis was employed to assess diagnostic performance. {ROC} curves showed that extremity crush injury was diagnosed using elasticity value and the greater the elasticity value, the greater the diagnostic value. {SSI} provides quantitative elasticity measurements, thus, adding complementary information that potentially could help in crush injury characterization with conventional ultrasonography.

                Ultrasonic wave interference produces local fluctuations in both the envelope, known as speckle, and phase of echoes. Furthermore, such fluctuations are correlated in space, and subsequent motion estimation from the envelope and/or phase signal produces patterned, correlated errors. Compounding, or combining information from multiple decorrelated looks, reduces such effects. We propose using a filter bank to create multiple looks to produce a compounded motion estimate. In particular, filtering in the lateral direction is shown to preserve delay estimation accuracy in the filtered sub-bands while creating decorrelation between sub-bands at the expense of some lateral resolution. For Gaussian apodization, we explicitly compute the induced signal decorrelation produced by Gabor filters. Furthermore, it is shown that lateral filtering is approximately equivalent to steering, in which filtered sub-bands correspond to signals extracted from shifted sub-apertures. Field {II} simulation of a point spread function verifies this claim. We use phase zero and its variants as displacement estimators for our compounded result. A simplified deformation model is used to provide computer simulations of deforming an elastic phantom. Simulations demonstrate root mean square error ({RMSE}) reduction in both displacement and strain of the compounded result over conventional and its laterally blurred versions. Then we apply the methods to experimental data using a commercial elastic phantom, demonstrating an improvement in strain {SNR}.

                Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging ({ARFI}) is a non-invasive method for the quantification of liver stiffness. We aimed to develop standards for the measuring procedure and studied the impact of different measuring sites.
                {ARFI} was tested in a tissue phantom and in 50 healthy volunteers. In addition, 116 patients with chronic liver disease underwent {ARFI}. The results were compared with histological staging (non-viral liver disease) and transient elastography (hepatitis C). {ARFI} diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves.
                {ARFI} results were not normally distributed in >20\% of cases. Deep inspiration significantly increased {ARFI} values by 13\% (p < 0.05). The mean shear-wave velocity in healthy individuals was 1.28 ± 0.19 m/s in the left liver lobe and 1.15 ± 0.17 m/s in the right liver lobe (p < 0.001). Similarly, in 79/116 patients with chronic liver disease a significant difference of shear-wave velocity between both liver lobes was detected. The histological staging correlated with {ARFI} results of the biopsy site (r = 0.661, p < 0.001) in non-viral liver disease (n = 47). The mean shear-wave velocity in cases with F1 and F2 fibrosis was increased in the left compared with the right liver lobe (2.1 ± 0.73 m/s vs. 1.75 ± 0.89 m/s, p = 0.041). Similar results were obtained in patients with hepatitis C (n = 69).
                Our study strengthens the necessity for definition of examination standards and demonstrates the usefulness of {ARFI} in non-viral liver disease. Interlobe variations of liver stiffness demand further investigation.

                The aim of this study was to perform the phantom experiment and demonstrate the clinical usefulness of tissue quantification using a linear array transducer and acoustic radiation force impulse ({ARFI}) technology.
                For the phantom study, the commercially available Elasticity {QA} Phantom Model 049 was used. First, we measured the shear wave velocity (m/s) for the four spheres and the background of the phantom. Then, the shear wave velocity at nine sites was measured, with the region of interest being moved gradually from a shallow region (3 mm) to a deeper region (38 mm). For the clinical study, the shear wave velocities of 15 solid breast mass lesions were measured.
                The phantom study confirmed the feasibility of quantitative determination of the degree of tissue hardness. Dispersion of the measured values tended to be somewhat increased for the depths of 3 mm and 38 mm. The mean shear wave velocity was 2.07-2.93 m/s for five benign lesions, whereas higher shear wave velocities (n = 2) (7.15, 7.44 m/s) or "{X.XX}" (unmeasurable state) (n = 7) were found for malignant lesions other than mucinous carcinoma (2.44 m/s).
                {ARFI} tissue quantification is a potentially promising ultrasonographic technique for diagnosing breast lesions.

                Displacement1 estimation is an essential step for ultrasound elastography and numerous techniques have been proposed to improve its quality using two frames of ultrasound {RF} data. This paper introduces a technique for calculating a displacement field from three frames of ultrasound {RF} data. To this end, we first introduce constraints on variations of the displacement field with time using mechanics of materials. These constraints are then used to generate a regularized cost function that incorporates amplitude similarity of three ultrasound images and displacement continuity. We optimize the cost function in an expectation maximization ({EM}) framework. Iteratively reweighted least squares ({IRLS}) is used to minimize the effect of outliers. We show that, compared to using two images, the new algorithm reduces the noise of the displacement estimation. The displacement field is used to generate strain images for quasi-static elastography. Phantom experiments and in-vivo patient trials of imaging liver tumors and monitoring thermal ablation therapy of liver cancer are presented for validation.

    abstract = {
                In this paper, a {2-D} locally regularized strain estimation method for imaging deformation of soft biological tissues from radio-frequency ({RF}) ultrasound ({US}) data is introduced. Contrary to most {2-D} techniques that model the compression-induced local displacement as a {2-D} shift, our algorithm also considers a local scaling factor in the axial direction. This direction-dependent model of tissue motion and deformation is induced by the highly anisotropic resolution of {RF} {US} images. Optimal parameters are computed through the constrained maximization of a similarity criterion defined as the normalized correlation coefficient. Its value at the solution is then used as an indicator of estimation reliability, the probability of correct estimation increasing with the correlation value. In case of correlation loss, the estimation integrates an additional constraint, imposing local continuity within displacement and strain fields. Using local scaling factors and regularization increase the method's robustness with regard to decorrelation noise, resulting in a wider range of precise measurements. Results on simulated {US} data from a mechanically homogeneous medium subjected to successive uniaxial loadings demonstrate that our method is theoretically able to accurately estimate strains up to 17\%. Experimental strain images of phantom and cut specimens of bovine liver clearly show the harder inclusions.

                A full-wave equation that describes nonlinear propagation in a heterogeneous attenuating medium is solved numerically with finite differences in the time domain ({FDTD}). Three-dimensional solutions of the equation are verified with water tank measurements of a commercial diagnostic ultrasound transducer and are shown to be in excellent agreement in terms of the fundamental and harmonic acoustic fields and the power spectrum at the focus. The linear and nonlinear components of the algorithm are also verified independently. In the linear nonattenuating regime solutions match results from Field {II}, a well established software package used in transducer modeling, to within 0.3 {dB}. Nonlinear plane wave propagation is shown to closely match results from the Galerkin method up to 4 times the fundamental frequency. In addition to thermoviscous attenuation we present a numerical solution of the relaxation attenuation laws that allows modeling of arbitrary frequency dependent attenuation, such as that observed in tissue. A perfectly matched layer ({PML}) is implemented at the boundaries with a numerical implementation that allows the {PML} to be used with high-order discretizations. A -78 {dB} reduction in the reflected amplitude is demonstrated. The numerical algorithm is used to simulate a diagnostic ultrasound pulse propagating through a histologically measured representation of human abdominal wall with spatial variation in the speed of sound, attenuation, nonlinearity, and density. An ultrasound image is created in silico using the same physical and algorithmic process used in an ultrasound scanner: a series of pulses are transmitted through heterogeneous scattering tissue and the received echoes are used in a delay-and-sum beam-forming algorithm to generate a images. The resulting harmonic image exhibits characteristic improvement in lesion boundary definition and contrast when compared with the fundamental image. We demonstrate a mechanism of harmonic image quality improvement by showing that the harmonic point spread function is less sensitive to reverberation clutter.

                An inhomogeneous wave equation is derived describing propagation and scattering of ultrasound in an inhomogeneous medium. The scattering term is a function of density and propagation velocity perturbations. The integral solution to the wave equation is combined with a general description of the field from typical transducers used in clinical ultrasound to yield a model for the received pulse-echo pressure field. Analytic expressions are found in the literature for a number of transducers, and any transducer excitation can be incorporated into the model. An example is given for a concave, nonapodized transducer in which the predicted pressure field is compared to a measured field.

                Modeling the acoustical process of soft biological tissue imaging and understanding the consequences of the approximations required by such modeling are key steps for accurately simulating ultrasonic scanning as well as estimating the scattering coefficient of the imaged matter. In this document, a linear solution to the inhomogeneous ultrasonic wave equation is proposed. The classical assumptions required for linearization are applied; however, no approximation is made in the mathematical development regarding density and speed of sound. This leads to an expression of the scattering term that establishes a correspondence between the signal measured by an ultrasound transducer and an intrinsic mechanical property of the imaged tissues. This expression shows that considering the scattering as a function of small variations in the density and speed of sound around their mean values along with classical assumptions in this domain is equivalent to associating the acoustical acquisition with a measure of the relative longitudinal bulk modulus. Comparison of the model proposed to Jensen's earlier model shows that it is also appropriate to perform accurate simulations of the acoustical imaging process.

                The correlation between various diseases and the change in the local mechanical properties of soft tissues has been long known. Over the past 20 years, there have been increasing research efforts to characterize mechanical properties of biological tissues using ultrasonic elastography. However, most of these works were based on characterization of only 1 type of waves (longitudinal or shear). The goal of this work was to devise a comprehensive ultrasound-based imaging method capable of measuring elastic parameters by combining both backscattered elastography and through-transmitted ultrasonic computed tomography.
                Our suggested technique provides measurements of both longitudinal and shear wave velocities. This enables the noninvasive computation of several tissue elasticity parameters such as Young's and shear moduli, Poisson's ratio, and, more importantly, the bulk modulus, the determination of which requires both wave velocities. Four different phantom types were examined: agar-gelatin-based phantoms and porcine fat tissue, turkey breast tissue, and bovine liver tissue in vitro specimens. The values of Young's modulus, the shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio were estimated and were consistent with values published in the literature.
                The average bulk modulus values of the phantoms +/- {SD} were 2.83 +/- 0.001, 2.25 +/- 0.01, 2.48 +/- 0.01, and 2.53 +/- 0.02 {GPa}, respectively. A statistically significant difference (P < .001) in the values of the bulk modulus of the different phantoms was found.
                The bulk modulus is suitable for differentiation between different tissue types. The obtained results show the feasibility of using a comprehensive ultrasonic imaging technique for noninvasive quantitative tissue characterization.

                Lipid and water together typically make up more than 90\% of the body's adipose tissue mass. Although some reports have shown that the fraction of lipid in adipose tissue is greater in obese people than in lean ones, the quantitative relationship between adipose lipid fraction and overall adiposity of the body has never been investigated. We dissected six male unembalmed cadavers and weighed all adipose tissue (range 9.7-25.7 kg), allowing the calculation of percentage adiposity as 100 x total adipose mass/body mass (range 17.8-43.9\%). Adipose tissue volume was determined by hydrostatic weighing of all portions of the dissected adipose tissue. For the six cadavers, whole body adipose tissue density ranged from 0.925-0.970 g/ml. Based on a three-component model of adipose tissue (lipid, water and dry fat-free solids), an expression for lipid fraction, F, was derived. After assuming densities for adipose lipid (0.905 g/ml), water at 36 degrees C (0.997 g/ml) and the dry fat-free component (1.38 g/ml), the equation simplified to F = {6.256/D}-5.912, where D is adipose tissue density (g/ml). Lipid fraction was then calculated for each of the six cadavers: the range (0.54-0.85) was in excellent agreement with published data. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.95, P < 0.005) between calculated lipid fraction and percentage adiposity. The regression equation predicting lipid fraction from percentage adiposity was y = 0.327 + 0.0124x. We conclude that the estimated fraction of lipid in human adipose tissue shows both a wide range and a strong positive linear relationship with overall body fatness.

                Linear elastic theory has served well in modeling the mechanical properties of numerous materials. In modeling ultrasonic wave propagation in biological soft tissues, an isotropic model has usually been employed. Many tissues, however, possess a lower order of symmetry, and the speed of sound in muscle is known to vary with the direction of propagation. In this study, by applying linear regression to acoustic microscopic data from seven frog sartorius specimens, four observable elastic constants associated with a transversely isotropic model were obtained. The average values of these constants were c11 = 2.64, c13 = 3.39 and c33 = 4.40 Nm-2 for resting muscles and c11 = 2.65, c13 = 3.43 and c33 = 4.57 Nm-2 for muscles undergoing tetanic contraction, where '1' and '3' represent the transverse and longitudinal axes, respectively. In all cases, c44 was 0, indicating a minimal contribution from longitudinal shear. For all seven specimens, the model of transverse isotropy provided a better fit of the data than that of isotropy.

                Measurements are reported on the propagation velocity of ultrasound in muscle tissue. This appears to be dependent on fiber direction for various muscle types (in vitro). Typical results are 1550 m/s perpendicular and 1557 m/s parallel to fiber direction (20 degrees C). A model is drawn up to relate such data to the elastic properties of muscle. It is shown that the assumptions: linear elastic behavior, homogeneity, and anisotropy with cylindrical symmetry, do not harmonize with the experimental results. A more elaborate model is suggested. Contraction dependence of the ultrasound velocity was investigated on human biceps muscle (in vivo) and frog gastrognemius muscle (in vitro). The measured velocity increase in biceps muscle during contraction--up to 3 m/s--is attributed to a varying blood content of the muscle. In (in vitro) frog muscle contraction is not accompanied by a change in ultrasound velocity. This suggests that increased muscle stiffness is not appreciably reflected in ultrasound velocity.

                An ultrasonic technique and microtensile testing were used to determine the Young's modulus of individual trabeculae and micro-specimens of cortical bone cut to similar size as individual trabeculae. The average trabecular Young's modulus measured ultrasonically and mechanically was 14.8 {GPa} ({S.D}. 1.4) and 10.4 ({S.D}. 3.5) and the average Young's modulus of microspecimens of cortical bone measured ultrasonically and mechanically was 20.7 {GPa} ({S.D}. 1.9) and 18.6 {GPa} ({S.D}. 3.5). With either testing technique the mean trabecular Young's modulus was found to be significantly less than that of cortical bone (p < 0.0001). However, the specimens were dried before microtensile testing so Young's modulus values may have been greater than those of trabeculae in vivo. Using Young's modulus measurements obtained from 450 cubes of cancellous bone and 256 cubes of cortical bone, Wolff's hypothesis that cortical bone is simply dense cancellous bone was tested. A multiple regression analysis that controlled for group membership showed that Young's modulus of cortical bone cannot be extrapolated from the Young's modulus vs density relationship for cancellous bone, yet the Young's modulus of trabeculae can be predicted by extrapolation from the relationship between Young's modulus vs density of the cancellous bone. These results suggest that when considered mechanically, cortical and trabecular bone are not the same material.

                The most common complication associated with immobilization is pressure sores caused by sustained localized tissue strain and stress. Computational simulations have provided insight into tissue stress-strain distribution, subject to loading conditions. In the simulation process, adequate soft tissue material parameters are indispensable. An in vivo procedure to characterise material parameters of human gluteal skin/fat and muscle tissue has been developed. It employs a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device together with an MRI compatible loading device. Using the derived data as constraints in an iterative optimization process the inverse finite element (FE) method was applied. FE-models were built and the material constants describing skin/fat and muscle tissue were parameterized and optimized. Separate parameter sets for human gluteal skin/fat and muscle were established. The long-term shear modulus for human gluteal skin/fat was G\_{infinity, S/F}= 1182 Pa and for muscle G\_{infinity, M} = 1025 Pa. The Ogden form for slightly compressible materials was chosen to define passive human gluteal soft tissue material behaviour. To verify the approach, the human skin/fat-muscle tissue compound was simulated using the derived material parameter sets and the simulation result was compared to empirical values. A correlation factor of R;{2} = 0.997 was achieved.

                Biodynamic responses of the finger-hand-arm system, such as apparent mass and mechanical impedance, characterize the relationship between the motion of the finger-hand-arm system and the dynamic force acting on the driving point, and they are useful for vibration exposure assessment. In the present study, a two-dimensional finite element ({FE}) model has been proposed to simulate the biodynamic responses of the fingerpad in vibration tests. The fingernail was supported by the rigid ground while the fingerpad was activated by a vibration probe. The fingertip model is composed of skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and nail. The soft tissues (i.e., skin and subcutaneous tissues) were assumed to be non-linearly elastic and linearly viscoelastic. The {FE} model was applied to predict the effects of pre-indentation of the vibration probe onto the fingerpad, the damping of the soft tissues, and probe mass on the magnitude and phase angle of the mechanical impedance and the apparent mass, as measured in the vibration tests. The model predictions showed that the probe mass has non-negligible effects on the measured biodynamic responses in the vibration tests. In order to determine "true" biodynamic responses of the finger-hand-arm system, the mass effects have to be cancelled using an appropriate approach. The present analysis provided a theoretical explanation, from a biomechanical point-of-view, for the inconsistencies in the published experimental data for the biodynamic responses of fingerpad.

                Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios of 6mm-sized cubes of equine cortical bone were measured in compression using a micro-mechanical loading device. Surface displacements were determined by electronic speckle pattern-correlation interferometry. This method allows for non-destructive testing of very small samples in water. Analyses of standard materials showed that the method is accurate and precise for determining both Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Material properties were determined concurrently in three orthogonal anatomic directions (axial, radial and transverse). Young's modulus values were found to be anisotropic and consistent with values of equine cortical bone reported in the literature. Poisson's ratios were also found to be anisotropic, but lower than those previously reported. Poisson's ratios for the radial-transverse and transverse-radial directions were 0.15+/-0.02, for the axial-transverse and axial-radial directions 0.19+/-0.04, and for the transverse-axial and radial-axial direction 0.09+/-0.02 ({mean+/-SD}). Cubes located only millimetres apart had significantly different elastic properties, showing that significant spatial variation occurs in equine cortical bone.

                Bone mineral density variations throughout the sacrum were measured and correlated with sacral screw insertion torque.
                To quantify bone mineral density variations within the S1 body and ala of young human specimens, especially along the pathways of sacral screws, and to examine the relation between sacral screw fixation and bone mineral density.
                Vertebral bone quality is an essential factor in anterior or posterior screw fixation of the spine. Several studies have been conducted regarding bone mineral density variations in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine. However, such variations in bone mineral density in the sacrum have not been well documented.
                The bone mineral density of 13 sacral specimens from young male cadavers (mean age, 31 years) was measured using highly accurate quantitative computed tomography. Variations in bone mineral density were measured in five transverse layers and seven vertical columns within the S1 body, and in four transverse layers and six vertical columns within the ala. The sacral screw insertion torque was measured (unicortical and bicortical), and the correlation with bone mineral density was calculated.
                The mean bone mineral density of the S1 body was 381.9 +/- 59 mg/cm3, which was 31.9\% higher than that of the sacral ala (mean, 296.9 +/- 86 mg/cm3) (P < 0.05). Bone mineral density of the superior sacral endplate was higher than that of any other transverse layer. Columns near the lateral posterior and lateral anterior of the S1 body had the highest bone mineral density. In the ala, bone mineral density values of the internal columns (pedicle) were the highest. Screw insertion torque for bicortical purchase along the S1 pedicle correlated well with the bone mineral density of the S1 body (r = 0.67, P < 0.05).
                This study quantified the volumetric bone mineral density variations within the S1 body and ala, and a significant linear correlation between the screw insertion torque and bone mineral density was found. Optimal sacral screw insertion pathways were also outlined based on bone mineral density values.

                Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a tissue can be simultaneously obtained using two indentation tests with two different sized indentors in two indentations. Owing to the assumption of infinitesimal deformation of the indentation, the finite deformation effect of indentation on the calculated material parameters was not fully understood in the double indentation approach. However, indentation tests with infinitesimal deformation are not practical for the measurement of real tissues. Accordingly, finite element models were developed to simulate the indentation with different indentor diameters and different deformation ratios to investigate the finite deformation effect of indentation. The results indicated that Young's modulus E increased with the increase in the indentation deformation w, if the finite deformation effect of indentation was not considered. This phenomenon became obvious when Poisson's ratio v approached 0.5 and/or the ratio of indentor radius and tissue thickness a/h increased. The calculated Young's modulus could be different by 23\% at 10\% deformation in comparison with its real value. The results also demonstrated that the finite deformation effect to indentation on the calculation of Poisson's ratio v was much smaller. After the finite deformation effect of indentation was considered, the error of the calculated Young's modulus could be controlled within 5\% (a/h = 1) and 2\% (a/h = 2) for deformation up to 10\%.

@article{meunier95,

                A theoretical model was previously developed to evaluate the relationship between the dynamics of ultrasonic speckle and its underlying tissue. The model is divided into an instrumental part represented by the point spread function (in the far field) of the ultrasonic apparatus and a moving tissue component described by a collection of scatterers. By computing the convolution of these terms and then the envelope, one obtains a simulated ultrasonic speckle pattern sequence which shows speckle motions closely linked to the tissue dynamics when small motion amplitudes are involved. Here, a theoretical study of the correlation between various linear transformations of the tissue and the corresponding ultrasonic speckle motions is performed, based on a {2D} extension of the envelope cross-correlation analysis of a narrow-band Gaussian noise. In the linear scan case, obviously, tissue translation generates an identical speckle translation. However, tissue/speckle motion correlation decreases with increasing rotation and/or biaxial deformation, lateral deformation (perpendicular to the beam propagation axis) being much less sensitive. With respect to the transducer frequency, the rotation and the axial deformation of the tissue show a better relationship with their respective speckle motion at lower frequencies while lateral deformation correlation is independent of the pulse frequency. With respect to beam (pulse) size parameters, tissue/speckle correlation decreases with rotation when a wide ultrasonic beam is used while the axial deformation correlation decreases with the axial duration of the pulse. This study sets the ground for the development of an ultrasonic strain gauge particularly useful for the assessment of biomechanical soft tissue and fluid flow properties based on speckle tracking.

    abstract = {To evaluate the dynamic range of tissue imaged by elastography, the mechanical behavior of breast and prostate tissue samples subject to compression loading has been investigated. A model for the loading was validated and used to guide the experimental design for data collection. The model allowed the use of small samples that could be considered homogeneous; this assumption was confirmed by histological analysis. The samples were tested at three strain rates to evaluate the viscoelastic nature of the material and determine the validity of modeling the tissue as an elastic material for the strain rates of interest. For loading frequencies above 1 Hz, the storage modulus accounted for over 93 percent of the complex modulus. The data show that breast fat tissue has a constant modulus over the strain range tested while the other tissues have a modulus that is dependent on the strain level. The fibrous tissue samples from the breast were found to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stiffer than fat tissue. Normal glandular breast tissue was found to have an elastic modulus similar to that of fat at low strain levels, but the modulus of the glandular tissue increased by an order of magnitude above fat at high strain levels. Carcinomas from the breast were stiffer than the other tissues at the higher strain level; intraductal in situ carcinomas were like fat at the low strain level and much stiffer than glandular tissue at the high strain level. Infiltrating ductal carcinomas were much stiffer than any of the other breast tissues. Normal prostate tissue has a modulus that is lower than the modulus of the prostate cancers tested. Tissue from prostate with benign prostatic hyperplasia ({BPH}) had modulus values significantly lower than normal tissue. There was a constant but not significant difference in the modulus of tissues taken from the anterior and posterior portions of the gland.},

                The clinical viability of a method of acoustic remote palpation, capable of imaging local variations in the mechanical properties of soft tissue using acoustic radiation force impulse ({ARFI}) imaging, is investigated in vivo. In this method, focused ultrasound ({US}) is used to apply localized radiation force to small volumes of tissue (2 mm(3)) for short durations (less than 1 ms) and the resulting tissue displacements are mapped using ultrasonic correlation-based methods. The tissue displacements are inversely proportional to the stiffness of the tissue and, thus, a stiffer region of tissue exhibits smaller displacements than a more compliant region. Due to the short duration of the force application, this method provides information about the mechanical impulse response of the tissue, which reflects variations in tissue viscoelastic characteristics. In this paper, experimental results are presented demonstrating that displacements on the order of 10 microm can be generated and detected in soft tissues in vivo using a single transducer on a modified diagnostic {US} scanner. Differences in the magnitude of displacement and the transient response of tissue are correlated with tissue structures in matched B-mode images. The results comprise the first in vivo {ARFI} images, and support the clinical feasibility of a radiation force-based remote palpation imaging system.

                Paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in venous blood is a naturally occurring contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). By accentuating the effects of this agent through the use of gradient-echo techniques in high fields, we demonstrate in vivo images of brain microvasculature with image contrast reflecting the blood oxygen level. This blood oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD}) contrast follows blood oxygen changes induced by anesthetics, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and by inhaled gas mixtures that alter metabolic demand or blood flow. The results suggest that {BOLD} contrast can be used to provide in vivo real-time maps of blood oxygenation in the brain under normal physiological conditions. {BOLD} contrast adds an additional feature to magnetic resonance imaging and complements other techniques that are attempting to provide positron emission tomography-like measurements related to regional neural activity.

@article{toussaint96,
    abstract = {Using nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}), we have examined the relationship of high-energy phosphate metabolism and perfusion in human soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. With {31P}-{NMR} spectroscopy, we monitored phosphocreatine ({PCr}) decay and recovery in eight normal volunteers and four heart failure patients performing ischemic plantar flexion. By using echo-planar imaging, perfusion was independently measured by a local [inversion-recovery (T1-flow)] and a regional technique ({NMR}-plethysmography). After correction for its {pH} dependence, {PCr} recovery time constant is 27.5 +/- 8.0 s in normal volunteers, with mean flow 118 +/- 75 (soleus and gastrocnemius T1-flow) and 30.2 +/- 9.7 ml.100 ml-1.min-1 ({NMR}-plethysmography-flow). We demonstrate a positive correlation between {PCr} time constant and local perfusion given by y = 50 - 0.15x (r2 = 0.68, P = 0.01) for the 8 normal subjects, and y = 64 - 0.24x (r2 = 0.83, P = 0.0001) for the 12 subjects recruited in the study. Regional perfusion techniques also show a significant but weaker correlation. Using this totally noninvasive method, we conclude that aerobic {ATP} resynthesis is related to the magnitude of perfusion, i.e., O2 availability, and demonstrate that magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy together can accurately assess muscle functional status.},

The magnitude of the {MRI}-measured {DeltaSI} was not significantly different using {TR} of 2000 vs 500 ms, or using spin-echo vs gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequences. However, {DeltaSI} measured by gradient-echo sequences was significantly greater at 3 vs 1.5 T (3.8 +/- 0.8 vs 1.6 +/- 0.2 \%, n = 5). The time course of the transient {DeltaSI} (peak at 7.9 +/- 0.4 s after each contraction, decay with half-time of 4.6 +/- 0.6 s) was comparable to the time course of the transient increase in relative heme saturation (13 +/- 2 \%, n = 5) measured after single contractions in another group of subjects by near-infrared spectroscopy (peak at 9.3 +/- 0.5 s, decay with half-time 6.2 +/- 0.8 s, n = 8). Simulations of intravascular and extravascular blood-oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD}) effects in muscle suggested that intravascular {BOLD} makes a major contribution to the transient changes, although other factors such as increased vascular volume or increased muscle cell T2 may also contribute. The transients can be exploited for muscle functional imaging analogous to {BOLD}-based brain functional imaging, and might provide an index of peripheral vascular function.},

    abstract = {A common but potentially severe malady afflicting permanent wheelchair users is pressure sores caused by elevated soft tissue strains and stresses over a critical prolonged period of time. Presently, there is paucity of information regarding deep soft tissue strains and stresses in the buttocks of humans during sitting. Strain and stress distributions in deep muscle and fat tissues were therefore calculated in six healthy subjects during sitting, in a double-donut {Open-MR} system, using a "reverse engineering" approach. Specifically, finite element ({FE}) models of the undeformed buttock were built for each subject using {MR} images taken at the coronal plane in a non-weight-bearing sitting posture. Using a second {MR} image taken from each subject during weight-bearing sitting we characterized the ischial tuberosity sagging toward the sitting surface in weight-bearing, and used these data as displacement boundary conditions for the {FE} models. These subject-specific {FE} analyses showed that maximal tissue strains and stresses occur in the gluteal muscles, not in fat or at the skin near the body-seat interface. Peak principal compressive strain and stress in the gluteus muscle were 74+/-7\% and 32+/-9 {kPa} (mean+/-standard deviation), respectively. Peak principal compressive strain and stress in enveloping fat tissue were 46+/-7\% and 18+/-4 {kPa}, respectively. Models were validated by comparing measured peak interface pressures under the ischial tuberosities (17+/-4 {kPa}) with those calculated by means of {FE} (18+/-3 {kPa}), for each subject. This is the first study to quantify sub-dermal tissue strain and stress distributions in sitting humans, in vivo. These data are essential for understanding the aetiology of pressure sores, particularly those that were recently termed "deep tissue injury" at the {US} National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel ({NPUAP}) 2005 Consensus Conference.},

The purposes of this study were to test the hypothesis that the secondary rise occurs earlier during more intense contractions, and to determine the contribution of {BOLD} contrast to the {SI} changes. Eight subjects performed 90-s isometric dorsiflexion contractions at 30\% and 60\% of maximum voluntary contraction ({MVC}) while T(2)-weighted ({TR}/{TE} = 4000 ms/35 ms) images were acquired and total hemoglobin ([{THb}]) and {oxy-Hb} saturation (\%{HbO}(2)) were measured. At 30\% {MVC}, [{THb}] remained constant and \%{HbO}(2) decreased from 66.3\% (standard error [{SEM}] = 2.6\%) to 32.4\% ({SEM} = 6.4\%). At t = 88 s, {SI} increased by approximately 8\% and was greater than at t = 8 and 56 s. At 60\% {MVC}, [{THb}] remained constant and \%{HbO}(2) decreased from 70.2\% ({SEM} = 2.3\%) to 40.4\% ({SEM} = 5.4\%). {SI} increased by approximately 17\% and at t = 56 and 88 s was greater than at t = 8 and 20 s. The absolute contribution of calculated {BOLD} effects was -1\% at 30\% and 60\% {MVC}. The relative contribution was greater at 30\% than at 60\% {MVC} (up to -26\% and -10\%, respectively). We conclude that the secondary rise occurs earlier at 60\% {MVC} and that the relative contribution of {BOLD} effects is greater during less intense contractions.},

@article{maurice04,

                Changes in vessel wall elasticity may be indicative of vessel pathologies. It is known, for example, that the presence of plaque stiffens the vascular wall, and that the heterogeneity of its composition may lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Another domain of application where ultrasound elastography may be of interest is the study of vascular wall elasticity to predict the risk of aneurysmal tissue rupture. In this paper, this technology is introduced as an approach to noninvasively characterize superficial arteries. In such a case, a linear array ultrasound transducer is applied on the skin over the region of interest, and the arterial tissue is dilated by the normal cardiac pulsation. The elastograms, the equivalent elasticity images, are computed from the assessment of the vascular tissue motion. Investigating the forward problem, it is shown that motion parameters might be difficult to interpret; that is because tissue motion occurs radially within the vessel wall while the ultrasound beam propagates axially. As a consequence of that, the elastograms are subjected to hardening and softening artefacts, which are to be counteracted. In this paper, the Von Mises ({VM}) coefficient is proposed as a new parameter to circumvent such mechanical artefacts and to appropriately characterize the vessel wall. Regarding the motion assessment, the Lagrangian estimator was used; that is because it provides the full two-dimensional strain tensor necessary to compute the {VM} coefficient. The theoretical model was validated with biomechanical simulations of the vascular wall properties. The results allow believing in the potential of the method to differentiate hard plaques and lipid pools from normal vascular tissue. Potential in vivo implementation of noninvasive vascular elastography to characterize abdominal aneurysms and superficial arteries such as the femoral and the carotid is discussed.

                Chronic hepatitis is accompanied by progressive deposit of hepatic fibrosis, which may lead to cirrhosis. Evaluation of liver fibrosis is, thus, of great clinical interest and, up to now, has been assessed with liver biopsy. This work aims to evaluate a new noninvasive device to quantify liver fibrosis: the shear elasticity probe or fibroscan. This device is based on one-dimensional ({1-D}) transient elastography, a technique that uses both ultrasound ({US}) (5 {MHz}) and low-frequency (50 Hz) elastic waves, whose propagation velocity is directly related to elasticity. The intra- and interoperator reproducibility of the technique, as well as its ability to quantify liver fibrosis, were evaluated in 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Liver elasticity measurements were reproducible (standardized coefficient of variation: 3\%), operator-independent and well correlated (partial correlation coefficient = 0.71, p < < 0.0001) to fibrosis grade ({METAVIR}). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves were 0.88 and 0.99 for the diagnosis of patients with significant fibrosis (>/= F2) and with cirrhosis ( = F4), respectively. The Fibroscan is a noninvasive, painless, rapid and objective method to quantify liver fibrosis.

Based on our first experiences with real-time elastography in the field of prostate diagnostics we evaluate its usefulness for biopsy guidance for prostate cancer detection.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}:
After imaging with conventional B-mode ultrasound in conjunction with real-time elastography 404 men underwent systematic sextant biopsy.

{RESULTS}:
Overall prostate cancer was found in 151 of 404 cases (37.4\%). In 127 of 151 cases (84.1\%), prostate cancer was detected using real-time elastography as an additional diagnostic feature.

{CONCLUSIONS}:
The results show that it is possible to detect prostate cancer with a high degree of sensitivity using real-time elastography in conjunction with conventional diagnostic methods for guided prostate biopsies.},

@article{tanter08,
    abstract = {This paper presents an initial clinical evaluation of in vivo elastography for breast lesion imaging using the concept of supersonic shear imaging. This technique is based on the combination of a radiation force induced in tissue by an ultrasonic beam and an ultrafast imaging sequence capable of catching in real time the propagation of the resulting shear waves. The local shear wave velocity is recovered using a time-offlight technique and enables the {2-D} mapping of shear elasticity. This imaging modality is implemented on a conventional linear probe driven by a dedicated ultrafast echographic device. Consequently, it can be performed during a standard echographic examination. The clinical investigation was performed on 15 patients, which corresponded to 15 lesions (4 cases {BI}-{RADS} 3, 7 cases {BI}-{RADS} 4 and 4 cases {BI}-{RADS} 5). The ability of the supersonic shear imaging technique to provide a quantitative and local estimation of the shear modulus of abnormalities with a millimetric resolution is illustrated on several malignant (invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma) and benign cases (fibrocystic changes and viscous cysts). In the investigated cases, malignant lesions were found to be significantly different from benign solid lesions with respect to their elasticity values. Cystic lesions have shown no shear wave propagate at all in the lesion (because shear waves do not propage in liquid). These preliminary clinical results directly demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this new elastography technique in providing quantitative assessment of relative stiffness of breast tissues. This technique of evaluating tissue elasticity gives valuable information that is complementary to the B-mode morphologic information. More extensive studies are necessary to validate the assumption that this new mode potentially helps the physician in both false-positive and false-negative rejection.},

    abstract = {Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a potentially life-threatening form of pressure ulcer that onsets in muscle tissue overlying bony prominences and progresses unnoticeably to more superficial tissues. To minimize {DTI}, the efficacy of wheelchair cushions should be evaluated not only based on their performance in redistributing interface pressures but also according to their effects on stress concentrations in deep tissues, particularly muscles. However, a standard bioengineering approach for such analyses is missing in literature. The goals of this study were to develop an algorithm to couple finite element ({FE}) modeling of the buttocks with an injury threshold for skeletal muscle and with a damage-stiffening law for injured muscle tissue, from previous animal experiments, to predict {DTI} onset and progression for different patient anatomies and wheelchair cushions. The algorithm was also employed for identifying intrinsic (anatomical) biomechanical risk factors for {DTI} onset. A set of three-dimensional {FE} models of seated human buttocks was developed, representing different severities of pathoanatomical changes observed in chronically sitting patients: muscle atrophy and "flattening" of the ischial tuberosity ({IT}). These models were then tested with cushions of different stiffnesses representing products available on the market and semirigid supports. Outcome measures were the percentage of damaged muscle tissue volumes after 90 min and 110 min of simulated continuous immobilized sitting as well as muscle injury rates post-60 min, -90 min, and -110 min of continuous sitting. Damaged muscle volumes grew exponentially with the level of muscle atrophy. For example, simulation of a subject with 70\% muscle atrophy sitting on a soft cushion showed damage to 33\% of the muscle volume after 90 min of immobilized sitting, whereas a comparable simulation with a nonatrophied muscle yielded only 0.4\% damaged tissue volume. The rates of {DTI} progression also increased substantially with increasing severities of muscle atrophy, e.g., 70\% atrophy resulted in 8.9, 2.7, and 1.6 times greater injury rates compared with the "reference" muscle thickness cases, after 60 min, 90 min, and 110 min of sitting, respectively. Across all simulation cases, muscle injury rate was higher when a "flatter" {IT} was simulated. Stiffer cushions increased both the extent and rate of {DTI} at times shorter than 90 min of continuous sitting, but after 110 min, volumes and rates of tissue damage converged to approximately similar values across the different cushion materials. The present methodology is a practical tool for evaluating the performances of cushions in reducing the risk for {DTI} in a manner that goes far beyond the commonly accepted measurements of sitting pressures.},

    abstract = {
                The primary etiologic factor in the production of pressure sores is considered to be pressure-induced ischemia with the threshold being {35mmHg} for 2 hours. However, clinical evidence indicates that skin can withstand normothermic ischemia of 8 to 12 hours without necrosis. A detailed review of the literature indicates that previous experimental models are few in number and limited in clinical relevance. Therefore, a continuously monitored computer-controlled electromechanical pressure applicator was designed to produce pressure sores over the greater femoral trochanter of normal and paraplegic swine. Examination of the pressure site at 1 week revealed 3 groups of lesions: 1) muscle damage only, 2) muscle and deep dermis damage, and 3) full-thickness damage extending from bone to skin. A critical pressure-duration curve for the production of pressure sores is presented for normal swine. Muscle damage occurred at high pressure-short duration ({500mmHg}, 4 hours), whereas skin destruction required high pressure-long duration ({800mmHg}, 8 hours). On analysis, muscle is more sensitive than skin to the effects of pressure, and the initial pathologic changes occur in muscle. Skin breakdown did not occur with a pressure of {200mmHg} for 15 hours, thus contradicting previous statements that pressure exceeding {35mmHg} for 2 hours would cause ischemia with subsequent tissue necrosis resulting in a pressure sore. We hypothesis that normal tissue is far more resistant to pressure-induced ischemia that previously considered, and that the pressure-duration threshold for the production of pressure sores is lowered dramatically following changes in the soft tissue coverage due to paraplegia, infection, or repeated trauma.

    abstract = {Pressure ulcers constitute an important health problem. They affect lots of people with mobility disorder and they are difficult to detect and prevent because the damage begins on the muscle. This paper proposes a new approach to study pressure ulcers. We aim at developing a methodology to analyse the probability for a patient to develop a pressure ulcer, and that can detect risky situation. The idea is to relate the mobility disorder to autonomic nervous system ({ANS}) trouble. More precisely, the evaluation of the consequence of the discomfort on the {ANS} (stress induced by discomfort) can be relevant for the early detection of the pressure ulcer. Mobility is evaluated through movement measurement. This evaluation, at the interface between soft living tissues and any support has to consider the specificity of the human environment. Soft living tissues have non-linear mechanical properties making conventional rigid sensors non suitable for interface parameters measurement. A new actimeter system has been designed in order to study movements of the human body whatever its support while seating. The device is based on elementary active cells. The number of pressure cells can be easily adapted to the application. The spatial resolution is about 4 cm(2). In this paper, we compare activity measurement of a seated subject with his autonomic nervous system activity, recorded by E.motion device. It has been developed in order to record six parameters: skin potential, skin resistance, skin temperature, skin blood rate, instantaneous cardiac frequency and instantaneous respiratory frequency. The design, instrumentation, and first results are presented.},

@article{gefen05,
    abstract = {Pressure sores ({PS}) in deep muscles are potentially fatal and are considered one of the most costly complications in spinal cord injury patients. We hypothesize that continuous compression of the longissimus and gluteus muscles by the sacral and ischial bones during wheelchair sitting increases muscle stiffness around the bone-muscle interface over time, thereby causing muscles to bear intensified stresses in relentlessly widening regions, in a positive-feedback injury spiral. In this study, we measured long-term shear moduli of muscle tissue in vivo in rats after applying compression (35 {KPa} or 70 {KPa} for 1/4-2 h, N = 32), and evaluated tissue viability in matched groups (using phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin histology, N = 10). We found significant (1.8-fold to 3.3-fold, p < 0.05) stiffening of muscle tissue in vivo in muscles subjected to 35 {KPa} for 30 min or over, and in muscles subjected to 70 {KPa} for 15 min or over. By incorporating this effect into a finite element ({FE}) model of the buttocks of a wheelchair user we identified a mechanical stress wave which spreads from the bone-muscle interface outward through longissimus muscle tissue. After 4 h of {FE} simulated motionlessness, 50\%-60\% of the cross section of the longissimus was exposed to compressive stresses of 35 {KPa} or over (shown to induce cell death in rat muscle within 15 min). During these 4 h, the mean compressive stress across the transverse cross section of the longissimus increased by 30\%-40\%. The identification of the stiffening-stress-cell-death injury spiral developing during the initial 30 min of motionless sitting provides new mechanistic insight into deep {PS} formation and calls for reevaluation of the 1 h repositioning cycle recommended by the {U.S}.

@article{aoi08,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:
The concept of deep tissue injury under intact skin helps us understand the pathogenesis of pressure ulcers, but the best method for detecting and evaluating deep tissue injury remains to be established.

{METHODS}:
Intermediate-frequency ({10-MHz}) ultrasonography was performed to evaluate deep tissue injury. The authors analyzed 12 patients (nine male patients and three female patients aged 16 to 92 years) who showed deep tissue injury-related abnormal findings on ultrasonography at the first examination and were followed up until the pressure ulcer reached a final stage.

{RESULTS}:
The stage of ulcer worsened in six of 12 cases compared with baseline, and healed in the remaining six patients. The authors recognized four types of abnormal signs unique to deep tissue damage in ultrasonography: unclear layered structure, hypoechoic lesion, discontinuous fascia, and heterogeneous hypoechoic area. Unclear layered structure, hypoechoic lesion, discontinuous fascia, and heterogeneous hypoechoic area were detected at the first examination in 12, 10, seven, and five patients, respectively. Unclear layered structure and hypoechoic lesion were more commonly seen in pressure ulcers in deep tissue injury than the other features, but the follow-up study suggested that discontinuous fascia and heterogeneous hypoechoic area are more reliable predictors of future progression of pressure ulcers.

{CONCLUSIONS}:
The use of intermediate-frequency ultrasound reliably identified deep tissue injury and was believed to contribute to prevention and treatment of pressure-related ulcers. The results suggest that specific ultrasonographic characteristics may predict which pressure ulcers will progress.},

@article{andersen08,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:
Pressure ulcers are globally of major concern and there is need for research in the pathogenesis for early intervention. Early studies have suggested existence of a hypo-echogenic subepidermal layer at the location of pressure ulcers, visualized by ultrasound scans. As a continuation, we here report on usability of four non-invasive techniques for evaluation of pressure ulcers.

{METHODS}:
Fifteen pressure ulcers in stage {0-IV} were examined using four different non-invasive techniques [redness index, skin temperature, skin elasticity (i.e. retraction time), and ultrasound scanning]. Measurements were made at the ulcer, 5 cm from the ulcer, and at a reference skin location without ulcers.

{RESULTS}:
The redness index was, in all cases, higher at the ulcers than at the reference skin. Temperature measurements were rather scattered. Ultrasound scans showed a hypo-echogenic subepidermal layer at all pressure ulcers, but none at the reference points. The skin retraction time was often higher at the location of a pressure ulcer than at the reference location. We found no correlation between the stage of the ulcers and temperature, redness index, subepidermal layer thickness, or retraction time.

{CONCLUSION}:
We conclude that temperature and elasticity measurements do not alone characterize ulceration severity, although redness index in some cases provides a useful indication. We assume that a subepidermal layer found on ultrasound images may be a measure of the pressure that the skin has been subjected to, rather than of the severity of the pressure ulceration. This method may be useful for predicting whether the skin is at risk of developing pressure ulcers. More studies are needed.},

    abstract = {Background/purpose: Skin elasticity has been assessed previously only in the surface layer. We developed a new method that uses tissue strain imaging ({TSI}) technology, and the aim of this study was to test this new method to assess internal skin elasticity. Methods: Using a pressure device with a 12 {MHz} ultrasound transducer, constant and linear compressions were applied to the cheek skin of 35 volunteers (aged: 20-60 years). The elasticity of each layer (dermis, subcutaneous and muscle) was measured and analyzed using the {TSI} application software incorporated into the Toshiba Aplio(™) {XV} ultrasound system. A skin tissue-equivalent phantom, which is a block of material with the acoustic velocity (1530 m/s) of human skin, was collaboratively developed by {OST} Inc. This phantom was placed between the skin and the transducer as a reference material. Results: Skin elasticity was clearly visualized and quantified in each layer of the skin. Age-dependent decreases in elasticity were determined in all layers of the skin. Among the three internal skin layers, the highest elasticity was determined in the subcutaneous layer followed by the muscle layer. Conclusion: These findings support the validity and sensitivity of the {TSI} method to assess the elasticity of various layers of skin.},

    abstract = {Pressure ulcers are a serious health problem for people with mobility disorders, like elders in acute care, long-term care, and home care settings. It also concerns paraplegics, tetraplegics or persons with burned injuries. Pressure ulcers result in significant morbidity and mortality. Consequences are a high human suffering, with high cost in terms of treatment. Several risk factors have been identified for the development of pressure ulcers: they are classified into extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors include interface pressure, shear forces, friction. Intrinsic factors are the nutritional state of the patient, its age, diseases. There is little information about the mechanism of the formation of pressure sores but it is agreed that it is a complex process. The difficulty of the prevention lies in the evaluation of these factors. It is an essential stage to optimize the preventative measures. Actually, no quantifiable parameters exist to predict the formation of a pressure ulcer. This article is aimed to propose new techniques developed for the early detection of pressure ulcers. First, extrinsic parameters as the interface pressure and its consequences on the mobility are investigated. A new actimeter is presented to monitor the movements of the patient. The second part is dedicated to the presentation of a new imaging technique which can help the physician to control tissue elasticity of the patient. The technique is called elastography, it is a {3D} strain estimation of soft biological tissues. Finally, the last way of investigation is the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors evaluation for a most relevant earlier diagnosis. Before the description of these techniques, it is essential to understand the phenomenology associated to the development of pressure sores. Only in this way, new techniques can be developed.},

    abstract = {The current research and development of {2D} (matrix-shaped) transducer arrays to acquire {3D} ultrasound data sets provides new insights into medical ultrasound applications and in particular into elastography. Until very recently, tissue strain estimation techniques commonly used in elastography were mainly {1D} or {2D} methods. In this paper, a {3D} technique estimating biological soft tissue deformation under load from ultrasound radiofrequency volume acquisitions is introduced. This method locally computes axial strains, while considering lateral and elevational motions. Optimal deformation parameters are estimated as those maximizing a similarity criterion, defined as the normalized correlation coefficient, between an initial region and its deformed version, when the latter is compensated for according to these parameters. The performance of our algorithm was assessed with numerical data reproducing the configuration of breast cancer, as well as a physical phantom mimicking a pressure ulcer. Simulation results show that the estimated strain fields are very close to the theoretical values, perfectly discriminating between the harder lesion and the surrounding medium. Experimental strain images of the physical phantom demonstrated the different structures of the medium, even though they are not all detectable on the ultrasound scans. Finally, both simulated and experimental results demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to provide good-quality elastograms, even in the conditions of significant out-of-plane motion.},

The lack of information and studies on the development of this pathology makes its prevention difficult. However, it is both acknowledged that lesions initiate in the deep muscular tissues before they expand to the skin, and that lesions are harder than healthy tissues. Elastography is therefore an interesting tool for an early detection of the pathology. A {3D} strain estimation algorithm is presented and evaluated on a {PVA}-cryogel phantom, mimicking a pressure ulcer at an early stage.},

    abstract = {﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Although pressure ulcer ({PrU}) development is now generally considered an indicator for quality of care, questions and concerns about situations in which they are unavoidable remain. Considering the importance of this issue and the lack of available research data, in 2010 the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel ({NPUAP}) hosted a multidisciplinary conference to establish consensus on whether there are individuals in whom pressure ulcer development may be unavoidable and whether a difference exists between end-of-life skin changes and pressure ulcers. Thirty-four stakeholder organizations from various disciplines were identified and invited to send a voting representative. Of those, 24 accepted the invitation. Before the conference, existing literature was identified and shared via a webinar. A {NPUAP} task force developed standardized consensus questions for items with none or limited evidence and an interactive protocol was used to develop consensus among conference delegates and attendees. Consensus was established to be 80\% agreement among conference delegates. Unanimous consensus was achieved for the following statements: most {PrUs} are avoidable; not all {PrUs} are avoidable; there are situations that render {PrU} development unavoidable, including hemodynamic instability that is worsened with physical movement and inability to maintain nutrition and hydration status and the presence of an advanced directive prohibiting artificial nutrition/hydration; pressure redistribution surfaces cannot replace turning and repositioning; and if enough pressure was removed from the external body the skin cannot always survive. Consensus was not obtained on the practicality or standard of turning patients every 2 hours nor on concerns surrounding the use of medical devices vis-\`{a}-vis their potential to cause skin damage. Research is needed to examine these issues, refine preventive practices in challenging situations, and identify the limits of prevention.},

Causes include pressure over bony prominences, shearing force, destruction of skin, and compromised blood flow. Evidence is emerging of the importance of ischemia as a primary causative agent, rather than pressure, which needs further investigation. Scales, staging, and treatment and prevention guidelines should be used with caution due to their arbitrary implementation and lack of evidence-based support. Unfortunately, much of the research and expert opinion developed by the government and touted as regulation lacks appropriate strength-of-evidence.

Of the 141 baccalaureate nurses ({BSN}) employed by the hospital at the time of the study, 106 consented to participate. Using a Portuguese version of Pieper's Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Test ({PUKT}), participants were asked to indicate whether 33 statements about {PU} prevention and eight about {PU} assessment and staging were true or false. For the 33 prevention statements, the average number answered correctly was 26.07 ({SD} 4.93) and for the eight assessment statements the average was 4.59 ({SD} 1.62). Nurses working on inpatient clinical nursing units had significantly better scores (P = 0.000). Years of nursing experience had a weak and negative correlation with correct {PUKT} scores (r = -0.21, P = 0.033) as did years of experience working in the university hospital (r = -.179, P <.071). Incorrect responses were most common for statements related to patient positioning, massage, {PU} assessment, and staging definitions. The results of this study confirm that nurses have an overall understanding of {PU} prevention and assessment principles but important knowledge deficits exist. Focused continuing education efforts are needed to facilitate the implementation of evidence-based care.},

@article{then09,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:
Finite element ({FE}) simulations of mechanical tissue loading help provide insight into internal tissue stress and strain distribution. Thus, better understanding of pressure sore aetiology and pressure sore prophylaxis can be acquired. Indispensable in the simulation process is adequate mechanical description of interacting soft tissue and body support materials. Sufficient verification of employed material parameters is required.

{METHOD} {OF} {APPROACH}:
Gluteal soft tissue material parameters, previously derived from experimental tissue indentation of a geometrically limited buttock sub-domain are shown to be suitable in simulating complex deformation of the entire buttocks. In the context of parameter verification, defined tissue loading via a soft foam material specimen was performed. Making use of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), the scenario was scanned to gain tissue displacement information. Anatomical surface data was reconstructed and an {FE}-model of the experimental situation was generated and simulated. {MR}-image information was compared with simulation results.

{RESULTS}:
Deformation of gluteal skin/fat and passive muscle tissue and support material under loading was in good agreement with the corresponding {MR}-image data. Visual accordance was found for deformed skin boundary as well as for internal fat-muscle tissue boundaries by superimposing experimental and numerical output. In addition, section surface boundaries of the {MR}-images and the {FE}-model of skin/fat and muscle at the deformed state were discretized and sufficient sample points were provided. A correlation factor of R2= 0.998 for skin/fat deformation was derived, comparing simulation with {MRI} output.

{CONCLUSION}:
Reliability of employed tissue material parameters for use in realistic loading scenarios at finite strains including complex tissue and bone anatomy, non-linear tissue support material, multiple tissue types and contact interactions is shown.},

                Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a severe form of pressure ulcer where tissue damage starts in deep tissues underneath intact skin. In the present study, the contributions of deformation, ischemia, and reperfusion to skeletal muscle damage development were examined in a rat model during a 6-h period. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) was used to study perfusion (contrast-enhanced {MRI}) and tissue integrity (T2-weighted {MRI}). The levels of tissue deformation were estimated using finite element models. Complete ischemia caused a gradual homogeneous increase in T2 (∼20\% during the 6-h period). The effect of reperfusion on T2 was highly variable, depending on the anatomical location. In experiments involving deformation, inevitably associated with partial ischemia, a variable T2 increase (17-66\% during the 6-h period) was observed reflecting the significant variation in deformation (with two-dimensional strain energies of 0.60-1.51 J/mm) and ischemia (50.8-99.8\% of the leg) between experiments. These results imply that deformation, ischemia, and reperfusion all contribute to the damage process during prolonged loading, although their importance varies with time. The critical deformation threshold and period of ischemia that cause muscle damage will certainly vary between individuals. These variations are related to intrinsic factors, such as pathological state, which partly explain the individual susceptibility to the development of {DTI} and highlight the need for regular assessments of individual subjects.

@article{shabshin10,
    abstract = {Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a severe type of pressure ulcer, in which damage initiates under intact skin, in soft tissues that are mechanically deformed by load-bearing bony prominences. Sitting-acquired {DTI} typically occurs in the gluteus muscles that could sustain deformations by the weight-bearing ischial tuberosities ({ITs}). No clinical method currently exists for measuring internal tissue deformations; so design and selection of wheelchair cushions are based mostly on measuring sitting pressures. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of different commercial cushions on internal soft-tissue deformations under the {ITs}, using weight-bearing magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). We specifically compared muscle, superficial fat, and effective (muscle and fat together) tissue deformations while subjects (n = 10) sat on four cushions (two viscoelastic and two foam) and directly on a rigid support. Deformations were maximal in muscle tissue (mean approximately 70\%), twice more the amount than in fat (approximately 30\%). Effective soft-tissue deformations were approximately 50\% to approximately 60\%. Although cushions mildly reduced muscle deformations in the order of 10\%, theoretically, our interpretation suggests that this deformation level adds safe sitting time. This study demonstrated that weight-bearing {MRI} is applicable for evaluating wheelchair cushions and, in the future, may be a tool to systematically support cushion design and selection.},

    abstract = {Deep tissue injury ({DTI}) is a severe form of pressure ulcer that originates at the bone-muscle interface. It results from mechanical damage and ischemic injury due to unrelieved pressure. Currently, there are no established clinical methods to detect the formation of {DTI}. Moreover, despite the many recommended methods for preventing pressure ulcers, none so far has significantly reduced the incidence of {DTI}. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a new electrical stimulation-based intervention, termed intermittent electrical stimulation ({IES}), in ameliorating the factors leading to {DTI} in individuals with compromised mobility and sensation. Specifically, we sought to determine whether {IES}-induced contractions in the gluteal muscles can 1) reduce pressure in tissue surrounding bony prominences susceptible to the development of {DTI} and 2) increase oxygenation in deep tissue. Experiments were conducted in individuals with spinal cord injury, and two paradigms of {IES} were utilized to induce contractions in the gluteus maximus muscles of the seated participants. Changes in surface pressure around the ischial tuberosities were assessed using a pressure-sensing mattress, and changes in deep tissue oxygenation were indirectly assessed using T₂*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques. Both {IES} paradigms significantly reduced pressure around the bony prominences in the buttocks by an average of 10-26\% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, both {IES} paradigms induced significant increases in T₂* signal intensity ({SI}), indicating significant increases in tissue oxygenation, which were sustained for the duration of each 10-min trial (P < 0.05). Maximal increases in {SI} ranged from 2-3.3\% (arbitrary units). Direct measurements of oxygenation in adult rats revealed that {IES} produces up to a 100\% increase in tissue oxygenation. The results suggest that {IES} directly targets factors contributing to the development of {DTI} in people with reduced mobility and sensation and may therefore be an effective method for the prevention of deep pressure ulcers.},

@article{jaul10,
    abstract = {Pressure ulcers (pressure sores) continue to be a common health problem, particularly among the physically limited or bedridden elderly. The problem exists within the entire health framework, including hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities and private homes. For many elderly patients, pressure ulcers may become chronic for no apparent reason and remain so for prolonged periods, even for the remainder of the patient's lifetime. A large number of grade 3 and 4 pressure ulcers become chronic wounds, and the afflicted patient may even die from an ulcer complication (sepsis or osteomyelitis). The presence of a pressure ulcer constitutes a geriatric syndrome consisting of multifactorial pathological conditions. The accumulated effects of impairment due to immobility, nutritional deficiency and chronic diseases involving multiple systems predispose the aging skin of the elderly person to increasing vulnerability. The assessment and management of a pressure ulcer requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach in order to understand the patient with the ulcer. Factors to consider include the patient's underlying pathologies (such as obstructive lung disease or peripheral vascular disease), severity of his or her primary illness (such as an infection or hip fracture), co-morbidities (such as dementia or diabetes mellitus), functional state (activities of daily living), nutritional status (swallowing difficulties), and degree of social and emotional support; focusing on just the wound itself is not enough. An understanding of the physiological and pathological processes of aging skin throws light on the aetiology and pathogenesis of the development of pressure ulcers in the elderly. Each health discipline (nursing staff, aides, physician, dietitian, occupational and physical therapists, and social worker) has its own role to play in the assessment and management of the patient with a pressure ulcer. The goals of treating a pressure ulcer include avoiding any preventable contributing circumstances, such as immobilization after a hip fracture or acute infection. Once a pressure ulcer has developed, however, the goal is to heal it by optimizing regional blood flow (by use of a stent or vascular bypass surgery), managing underlying illnesses (such as diabetes, hypothyroidism or congestive heart failure) and providing adequate caloric and protein intake (whether through use of dietary supplements by mouth or by use of tube feeding). If the ulcer has become chronic, the ultimate goal changes from healing the wound to controlling symptoms (such as foul odour, pain, discomfort and infection) and preventing complications, thereby contributing to the patient's overall well-being; providing support for the patient's family is also important. Recent advances in wound dressings allow for greater control of symptoms and prevention of complications, and have also enabled the affected patient to be integrated more readily into the family setting and in the community at large. Ethical and end-of-life issues must also be addressed soon after the wound has become chronic. This article discusses the pathogenesis of pressure ulcer development in the elderly in relation to concomitant diseases, risk factor assessment and the management of such ulcers.},

@article{maklebust05,
    abstract = {Pressure ulcers are a common and frustrating problem. Pressure ulcers increase demands on health care resources and are sometimes a source of malpractice litigation. Skin breakdown, often an iatrogenic complication of hospitalization, increases the length of stay and contributes to mortality and morbidity. Long-term care facilities are under increasing regulatory pressure to reduce rates of pressure ulcer occurrence. The process-outcome link continues to escape us. Processes of care seem disjointed. Numerous studies show a failure to implement what we know. When pressure ulcer risk is identified, preventive measures often are not implemented. The literature is replete with reports of quality improvement activities that enumerate multiple opportunities to improve care related to pressure ulcers. Various quality improvement strategies for pressure ulcer prevention and management have been produced, but recommendations are not always applied to practice. When studies compared various outcomes before and after implementation of guidelines, most of the evidence was clinical audit data. Overall, active strategies were associated with better outcomes and passive strategies with poorer ones. Baier et al reported improvement in processes of care after using a structured quality improvement approach in the long-term care setting. Targeted education sessions were common to all studies reporting successful outcomes. Multidisciplinary wound care teams that conduct rounds at the bedside are highly recommended to enhance patient {outcomes.Functioning} interdisciplinary teams clearly represent an important approach to error reduction. To close the gap between risk identification and pressure ulcer prevention, we should develop active multidisciplinary wound care teams and "Strive for Six Sigma in Pressure Ulcer Care".},

@article{milne09,
    abstract = {Information about pressure ulcer prevalence, prevention, and optimal management strategies in the long-term acute care hospital ({LTACH}) setting is sparse. Although care processes in other patient care settings have been reported to affect pressure ulcer prevalence rates, the effect of such programs in the {LTACH} is unknown. To reduce perceived above-average pressure ulcer prevalence rates and improve care processes, a 108-bed {LTACH} used a failure mode and effects analysis to identify and address high-priority areas for improvement. Areas in need of improvement included a lack of 1) wound care professionals, 2) methods to consistently document prevention and wound data, and 3) an interdisciplinary wound care team approach, as well as a faulty electronic medical record. While prevalence data were collected, policies and procedures based on several published guidelines were developed and incorporated into the pressure ulcer plan of care by the newly established wound care team. Improved assessment and documentation methods, enhanced staff education, revised electronic records, wound care product reviews, and a facility-wide commitment to improved care resulted in a reduction of facility-acquired pressure ulcer prevalence from 41\% at baseline to an average of 4.2\% during the following 12 months as well as fewer missing electronic record data (<1\% of charts had missing data). These study results suggest that staff education, better documentation, and a dedicated wound care team improves care practices and reduces pressure ulcer prevalence in the {LTACH}. Studies to increase knowledge about the {LTACH} patient population and their unique needs and risk profiles are needed.},

@article{ingeman11,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}:
The relationship between in-hospital stroke-related medical complications and clinical outcome remains unclear. We examined whether medical complications were associated with length of stay ({LOS}) and mortality among stroke unit patients.

{METHODS}:
Using population-based Danish medical registries, we performed a follow-up study among all patients with acute stroke admitted to stroke units in 2 counties between 2003 and 2009 (n=13 721). Data regarding in-hospital medical complications, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pressure ulcer, falls, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and severe constipation together with {LOS} and mortality were prospectively registered.

{RESULTS}:
Overall, 25.2\% of patients (n=3453) experienced 1 or more medical complications during hospitalization. The most common complications were urinary tract infection (15.4\%), pneumonia (9.0\%), and constipation (6.8\%). Median {LOS} was 13 days (25th and 75th quartiles, 5 and 33). All medical complications were associated with longer {LOS}. The adjusted relative {LOS} extension ranged from 1.80 (95\% {CI}, 1.54-2.11) for pneumonia to 3.06 (95\% {CI}, 2.67-3.52) for falls. Patients with 1 or more complications had an increased 1-year mortality rate (adjusted mortality rate ratio [{MRR}], 1.20; 95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.39). The association was mainly because of pneumonia, which was associated with higher mortality both after 30 days (adjusted {MRR}, 1.59; 95\% {CI}, 1.31-1.93) and 1 year (adjusted {MRR}, 1.76; 95\% {CI}, 1.45-2.14).

{CONCLUSIONS}:
In-hospital medical complications were associated with longer {LOS} and some, in particular pneumonia, also with an increased mortality among patients with acute stroke.},

@article{khaled06,
    abstract = {Mechanical properties of biological tissue represent important diagnostic information and are of histological and pathological relevance. In order to obtain non-invasively mechanical properties of tissue, we developed a real-time strain imaging system for clinical applications. The output data of this system also allow an inverse elastography approach leading to the spatial distribution of the relative elastic modulus of tissue. The internal displacement field of biological tissue is determined using the above mentioned strain imaging system by applying quasi-static compression to the considered tissue. Axial displacements are calculated by comparing echo signal sets obtained prior to and immediately following less than 0.1\% compression, using the fast root seeking technique. Strain images representing mechanical tissue properties in a non-quantitative manner are displayed in real-time mode. For additional quantitative imaging, the stiffness distribution is calculated from the displacement field assuming the investigated material to be elastic, isotropic, and nearly incompressible. Different inverse problem approaches for calculating the shear modulus distribution using the internal displacement field have been implemented and compared. The results of an ongoing clinical study with more than 200 patients show, that our real-time strain imaging system is able to differentiate malignant and benign tissue areas in the prostate with a high degree of accuracy (sensitivity=76\% and specificity=89\%). The reconstruction approaches applied to the strain image data deliver quantitative tissue information and seem promising for an additional differential diagnosis of lesions in biological tissue. Our real-time system has the potential of improving diagnosis of prostate and breast cancer.},

    abstract = {Elastography is a new imaging modality where elastic tissue parameters related to the structural organization of normal and pathological tissues are imaged. Basic principles underlying the quasi-static elastography concept and principles are addressed. The rationale for elastographic imaging is reinforced using data on elastic properties of normal and abnormal soft tissues. The several orders of magnitude difference between the elastic modulus of normal and abnormal tissues which is the primary contrast mechanism in elastographic imaging underlines the probability of success with this imaging modality. Recent advances enabling the clinical practice of elastographic imaging in real-time on clinical ultrasound systems is also {discussed.In} quasi-static elastography, radiofrequency echo signals acquired before and after a small (about 1\%) of applied deformation are correlated to estimate tissue displacements. Local tissue displacement vector estimates between small segments of the pre- and post-deformation signals are estimated and the corresponding strain distribution imaged. Elastographic imaging techniques are based on the hypothesis that soft tissues deform more than stiffer tissue, and these differences can be quantified in images of the tissue strain tensor or the Young's {modulus.Clinical} applications of quasi-static elastography have mushroomed over the last decade, with the most commonly imaged areas being the breast, prostate, thyroid, cardiac, treatment monitoring of ablation procedures and vascular imaging applications.},
